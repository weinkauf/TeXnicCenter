The files in this directory and its subdirectories
are intended to test several parts of the TeXnicCenter-system.
Please note the statement at the top of all files.

The directory structure is as follows:
 <TXC-subsystem>\<test-purpose>\

You are invited to contribute to these tests.
If you do so, please ensure to supply a project-file (.tcp), if possible.
If you are a developer of TXC and want to add new test files or commit
changes to the existing ones, please do NOT add/commit files containing
"TeXnicCenterProjectSessionInformation" (.tps), if this is not what you
intend to test.

Please do NOT remove a test after you fixed a bug. The test shall stay
here for all times. If the test needs some changes to show up a new bug,
consider adding a new test. It is ok, to test several problems with one
project.

If you have further questions or if you want to support
further TeXnicCenter development, visit the TeXnicCenter-homepage
