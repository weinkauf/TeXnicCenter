The files in this directory and its subdirectories
are intended to test several parts of the TeXnicCenter-system.
Please note the statement at the top of all files.

The directory structure is as follows:
 <TXC-subsystem>\<test-purpose>\

You are invited to contribute to these tests.
If you do so, please ensure to supply a project-file (.tcp), if possible.
If you are a developer of TXC and want to add new test files or commit
changes to the existing ones, please do NOT add/commit files containing
"TeXnicCenterProjectSessionInformation" (.tps), if this is not what you
intend to test.

If you have further questions or if you want to support
further TeXnicCenter development, visit the TeXnicCenter-homepage
