%% OPTIONS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% ATTENTION: You need a main file to use this one here.
%%            Use the command "\input{filename}" in your
%%            main file to include this file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONS FOR SPACES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%Space between paragraphs: half the height of the small x
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5ex}

%%Indent at the beginning of a paragraph: set to zero
%\setlength{\parindent}{0ex}

%%Spacing between lines: 1.5 times
%% ==> Consider using the package 'setspace' instead.
%\linespread{1.5}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONS FOR HEADERS AND FOOTERS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%Example for quite nice headers
%% ==> Use '\usepackage{fancyhdr}' and '\pagestyle{fancy}'
%% ==> inside your main document to use this.
%\pagestyle{fancy}
%\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{#1}{}}
%\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection\ #1}}
%\fancyhf{}
%\fancyhead[LE,RO]{\thepage}
%\fancyhead[LO]{\rightmark}
