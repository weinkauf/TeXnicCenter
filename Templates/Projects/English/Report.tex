\chapter{Some small hints}\label{hints}

\section{German Umlauts and other Language Specific Characters}\label{umlauts}
You can type german umlauts like 'ä', 'ö', or 'ü' directly in this file.
This is also true for other language specific characters like 'é', 'è' etc.

Sometimes there are problems with hyphenation when using umlauts.
The following section deals with this.


\section{Automatic Hyphenation}\label{hypenation}
The long word in the following text should be splitted automatically.
But \LaTeX\ may have trouble doing this if a certain type of fonts is used
and language specific characters are in the word.

Test: A long and nonsense word Umlautäöüédoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoit.

If the long word exceeds the margin, then automatic hyphenation did not work.
You solve the problem as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recommended}\\
Install cm-super fonts. These are fonts for your \LaTeX\ system and they
have nothing to do with TeXnicCenter. If you work with mik\TeX,
please start the mik\TeX\ package manager (``Browse Packages'' in the start menu).
There you will find the cm-super fonts. Note: the package is rather large (ca.\ 70MB).
Automatic hyphenation will work afterwards.

\item \textbf{Not completely adequate alternative}\\
Include \verb#\usepackage{ae, aeguill}# into your document.
This will make hyphenation work, but searching for words with umlauts and such
in Adobe Reader will not work anymore.

\end{itemize}


\section{References}\label{references}
Using the commands \verb#\label{name}# and \verb#\ref{name}# you are able
to use references in your document. Advantage: You do not need to think
about numerations, because \LaTeX\ is doing that for you.

For example, in section \ref{dividing} on page \pageref{dividing} hints for
dividing large documents are given.

Certainly, references do also work for tables, figures, formulas\ldots

Please notice, that \LaTeX\ usually needs more than one run (mostly 2) to
resolve those references correctly.


\section{Dividing Large Documents}\label{dividing}
You can divide your \LaTeX-Document into an arbitrary number of \TeX-Files
to avoid too big and therefore unhandy files (e.g. one file for every chapter).

For this, you insert in your main file (this one) for every subfile
the command '\verb#\input{subfile}#'. This leads to the same behavior
as if the content of the subfile would be at the place of the \verb#\input#-Command.
