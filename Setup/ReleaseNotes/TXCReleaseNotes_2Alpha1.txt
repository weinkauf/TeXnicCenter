This is TeXnicCenter 2.0 Alpha 1 (2009/10/22)

This is an ALPHA version of the software. It is not stable, very likely to crash, and you may loose your data.

Having said that, the developers work with this version on a daily basis without too much trouble. It is designed to work alongside TeXnicCenter Version 1, i.e., you can have both installed in different directories.

TeXnicCenter 2.0 has lots of new features. We have changed almost everything. Most noteworthy:

* New editor component based on Scintilla (zoom, proportional fonts, code folding).
* Unicode support. You should be able to write in Russian, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, ... We are very interested in any issues that you may encounter regarding the Unicode support.
* Modern user interface. Try re-arranging the tool windows.
* Better support for bibtex (error parsing, search in Literature tool window).
* Developed with Visual Studio 2008. However, the free edition does not work. You need access to the MFC. If you are interested in helping us, contact the maintainer: http://www.texniccenter.org/contact/tino


Known Issues:

* Replace in selection: selection shrinks. Be careful with that.
* Spell check does not work inside braces {}. This may be a feature. Lets see.
* After auto-completion the cursor may end up at an unexpected position.
* TXC 1 and TXC 2 may compete for the file associations *.tex and *.tcp.
* Some toolbars re-appear after re-starting TXC.
* The defaults are not very user-friendly. Toolbars, menu, shortcuts are all subject to change in the future.


Happy TeXing!
