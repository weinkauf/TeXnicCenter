<p>We have released the latest and greatest version of TeXnicCenter. Finally, we left the beta stage of the current development branch and are bringing you the first fully stable version of TeXnicCenter in a long time.</p>

<p>If you are with us for a longer time, then you know that we have high standards when it comes to calling our software "stable." TeXnicCenter users are used to installing software that works stable, but is called "beta." Well, the software reached a maturity level that we developers feel it is time to also call it what it is: "stable."</p>

<p>As the maintainer, I want to express my gratitude to Sergiu Dotenco, who single-handedly transformed the old TXC 1.0 from the early 2000's into a modern application with a powerful editor, beautiful user interface and many other new features. This transformation was not simple and we worked for a long time on making it as mature as it is now.</p>

<p>So, there you are. Mid-September 2013. <a title="Download" href="http://www.texniccenter.org/download/">Download, download, download!</a></p>

<p>It may seem to some of you that there is a large team behind TeXnicCenter. I can assure you, this is not the case. To sustain the development or better even speed it up, YOU need to help us. Documentation, Tutorials, Project Templates, Autocompletion-Templates, actual C++ programming, ... all input is welcome. <a title="Contact" href="http://www.texniccenter.org/contact?si_contact_CID=1">Contact us!</a></p>

<p>Happy TeXing!</p>

<p>The TeXnicCenter Team</p>
