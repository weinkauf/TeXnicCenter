1. hg up

1a. Get the latest redistributable from Microsoft: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019667

2. Edit "TeXnicCenter\Version.h" appropriately.

3. Edit "TeXnicCenter\aboutbox.cpp" to reflect the current year and to make sure that all involved people are mentioned. (TODO: Need to change the manual update of the year.)

3a. If the credits have changed, run the Debug version and get the reST text from the Visual Studio output window. Use it for copyright.rst in the manual. Make sure to use the latest version of the manual. Note that the 'htmlhelp' output is manually merged with the 'TCHelp' folder in the TXC repo.

4. Edit "TeXnicCenter\res\TeXnicCenter.rc2" to reflect the current year. (TODO: Need to change the manual update of the year.) This file includes the generated Version.h.

5. Build. Test.

6. Change "setup\TeXnicCenter.iss" at the top to define the target Win32 or x64. Make sure, the rest of the setup script looks still good. Test building the setup.

7. Merge default into stable.

8. Create a tag for the release.

Namescheme: 'Release' MajorVersion (Alpha|Beta|.) MinorVersion
without any spaces

Examples:
Release2Alpha1
Release2Beta2
Release2.0
Release2.01

9. hg push.

10. rm Output/Product/*
rm Output/Intermediate/*

11. Rebuild All

12. Create setup. Can be found in Output/Setup/* with proper name.

13. Test setup on a fresh Windows (or in a virtual machine).

14. AntiVirus check of the freshly installed TXC.

15. Write Release Notes. Use this as a startinig point (where Release2Alpha3 stands for the tag of the last release):
    hg log -f --no-merges -r "tagged(Release2Alpha3)":: --template "{desc}\n\n" > TXCReleaseNotes_2Alpha4.txt

16. Upload the release notes and the setup file to sf.net. Just click on "Files". It requires Firefox or something similar.
    Create a subfolder for the release. Place the release notes as readme.txt in this folder (can be renamed on the server). It will always be displayed when people go into that folder (reST could be used, too). If the installer is going to be the new default, set it in its properties.

17. Change the download links at texniccenter.org.

18. Publish news at texniccenter.org and latex-community.org. texniccenter.org requires FireFox to edit an article properly.

19. Add a new milestone at sf.net for the User Reports. To do so, go to the user reports and click edit milestones. At the bottom, one can add a new one.
