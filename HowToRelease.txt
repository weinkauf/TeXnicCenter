    hg log -f -r "tagged(Release2Alpha3)":: > log.txt

16. Upload the release notes and the setup file to sf.net. Use the "Project Admin | File manager" tool. Check the release notes to be release notes. Set the release notes of the setup file to the new release notes file. If this is going to be the new default, set it in its properties as well.

17. Change the download link at texniccenter.org.

18. Publish news at texniccenter.org and latex-community.org. texniccenter.org requires FireFox to edit an article properly.
