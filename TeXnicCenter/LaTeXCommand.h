        Base class for all LaTeX entities provided in a style file, usually commands end environments.

        They may have optional parameters and have configurable text blocks, which are inserted before
        resp. behind the inserted command. E. g. in environments like
<code>
        \begin{myEnv}
        \end{myEnv}
</code>
        a common value for the <tt>ExpandBefore</tt> attribute is '\begin{' resp.
        '}\end{myEnv}' for the <tt>ExpandAfter</tt> attribute.

        The class CNewEnvironment use these values as default.
