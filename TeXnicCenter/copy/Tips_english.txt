Welcome to TeXnicCenter!\pWe have some tips for you, about how to use LaTeX and especially TeXnicCenter.\pLeave this dialog enabled for some time, until you think you know all features of TeXnicCenter. If you don't want to see the dialog anymore, you can uncheck the box in the lower left corner. You can popup this dialog every time by choosing the menu item 'Help|Tip of the day...'.
It's always hard to get started.\pWe created some templates for you to ease the pain. Open the dialog for creating a new project ('File|New Project...') and try out the templates.
To create a printable file (DVI, PS, or PDF), you have to let LaTeX process your document. This is called 'compiling'.\pTeXnicCenter supports you. The menu 'Build' contains all the commands to generate and view output files.
Working with TeXnicCenter is easiest if you work with projects.\pNew projects are created with 'File|New Project...'\pFor existing TEX-files you create a project by first loading the file and then choosing the menu item 'Project|Create with active file as main file'.
You can insert LaTeX-constructs and -symbols simply by menu or short cut. Take a look at the 'Insert' and 'Math'-menu...
You can compile your LaTeX document into different formats. This includes PDF, Postscript (PS) and DVI amongst others.\pIn order to change the output format, choose the menu item 'Build|Select Output Profile...'.\pA similar drop down box can be found in the LaTeX toolbar.
Behind the seemingly simple output profiles (e.g. "LaTeX => PDF") are rather complex commands to external programs like the LaTeX compiler or the respective viewer.\pTake your time to have a look at these commands: 'Build|Define Output Profiles...'\pThis dialog features a wizard, too, which restores the standard configuration (if something went wrong while testing...).
Projects, Projects, Projects!\pOnly if you work with projects, TexnicCenter is able to generate a structure of your document.\pCreate a project ('File|New Project...' or 'Project|Create with active file as main file') and activate the outline view using 'View|Tool Windows|Outline'.
The tree view on the left of the TeXnicCenter-window shows the document structure of the opened project.\pIf you double click on an item in the view, the corresponding file is opened and the cursor is set accordingly.\pIf you click the right mouse button a menu is opened, that allows you to insert a reference to the specified item at the current position in the text.\pThe tree view is updated, every time you save a file.
You can use german umlauts ('ä', 'ü', "ö") and other language specific characters in your documents, if you insert the instructions\p\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}\n\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}\pin the preamble of your document.\pInstead of 'ngerman' you can also use 'francais', 'polish', 'spanish', 'russian', 'italian', 'czech', 'klingon', and so on.
The automatic hyphenation works in international texts with umlauts ('ä', 'ü', "ö") and other language specific characters only, if so-called T1-encoded fonts are available to LaTeX.\pThere are different ways to achieve this. One way is to use the Latin Modern fonts by putting these commands into the preamble of your document:\p\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\usepackage{lmodern}
TeXnicCenter can replace quotation marks (") after typing with other character combinations, so that you can use special opening and closing quotation marks.\pTo enable and configure this option, choose 'Options...' from the 'Tools'-menu and select the 'General'-tab.
You can split your LaTeX-document into many TEX-files to avoid large and cluttered files (e.g. one file for each chapter).\pInsert "\input{subfile}" into your project's main file for each file you wish to include. This will have the same effect as placing the text of 'subfile' at the position where the "\input"-command is placed.
You can ask TeXnicCenter to save all opened documents periodically without disturbing you.\pEnable the option 'Save automatic' on the 'File'-tab in the 'Tools|Options...'-dialog and select a suitable save interval.
The command 'Search|Go To last Change' places the cursor on the line in the current document, where the last editing operation has been taken place.\pThis is comfortable if you scroll through the document "just to look for something", but like to continue editing at the position, you made your last operations.
With the shortcut Ctrl+F2 you can set a bookmark at the current line in the editor.\pWith the shortcut F2 you can jump to the next bookmark.\pThere is also a window showing all bookmarks. Activate it using 'View|Tool Windows|Bookmarks'. Here, you can also give proper names to your bookmarks.
To embed graphics into your LaTeX-document, you have to place the command "\usepackage{graphicx}" in the preamble of your document. You can insert an inclusion command by choosing 'Insert|Graphics...' from the menu.\pThe next tip gives some more details about using graphics...
To create includable graphics, you can use an application that can export graphics in PDF or EPS format. Amongst others, Inkscape (www.inkscape.org) and OpenOffice.org Draw (www.openoffice.org) support these formats, and both are free software.\pSelect the relevant region in your drawing application and export the selection as a PDF or EPS file. You can include the resulting file by choosing 'Graphic...' from the 'Insert'-menu in TeXnicCenter.
Try the 'Search|Incremental Search' from the menu to do a quick text search. While you are typing, the searched string is shown in the status bar and the find text in the editor...
If you wish text to appear in the output exactly as entered in your LaTeX-file (especially usable for source code), you can put it into an verbatim-environment.\pSimply enclose your text with "\begin{verbatim}" and "\end{verbatim}".\pText that should appear inside a line of normal text, should be preceded by "\verb". The character that follows directly on "\verb" is also the character that ends the argument of the command (i.e. "\verb|C:\test\text.tex|" to get "C:\test\text.tex" in the output).\pAlternatively you can use the 'Insert|Code'-menu.
With the shortcut Ctrl+Tab you can switch between opened documents.
The command 'Window|Window List' displays a list of all open windows and enables you to close some of them or to activate one.
The toolbars of TeXnicCenter can be placed anywhere on the screen. Click on a non-used area of the toolbar and drag it to any position.\pYou can even do this with the menu bar - try to dock it on the left or right side of the window...
You can specify shortcuts for commands by opening the customization dialog with 'Tools|Customize'.
To set text italic in your document, you should use the "\emph{}"-command.\pSelect the text you would like to emphasize and choose 'Format|Character|Emphasize'.\pOr simply press Ctrl+E after you selected the text.
You can customize the menu and tool bars of TeXnicCenter for your needs. Simply drag a menu or tool bar button with pressed Alt-key to another bar or choose 'Tools|Customize...'.
The navigator bar (tree view on the left edge of the TeXnicCenter-window) and the output bar (at the bottom) can be resized by dragging the beam between the bar and the editor window.\pYou even can even place those bars anywhere on the screen by clicking on their title bars an dragging them to a suitable position.
The command Search|Search in Files...', you can search for a string in the files of an directory.\pThis feature is comfortable for finding text positions in a large LaTeX-document, that has been split into many files.
Now you have seen all tips!
