<p>TeXnicCenter provides a project management tool that helps to keep
the
files of one document together and to generate output for a
document.&nbsp; It is especially useful when working on large documents.</p>
<p>A project file will be generated for each project containing the
project's properties. The stored information is:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The path to the main file of the project, relative to the
directory the project file is placed in.&nbsp; (This file will be
passed to the LaTeX compiler.)</li>
  <li>A flag that specifies whether the current project uses BibTeX.</li>
  <li>A flag that specifies whether the current project uses MakeIndex.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Some features are only available if a project is opened.&nbsp;
Examples of these are Structure View (the navigator bar on the left
side of the main window) and the automatic invocation of BibTeX and
MakeIndex <br>
</p>
<p>Using projects is very simple. Just
<a href="project_create.html">create a new project</a> before starting
to work on a new document. If the requirements for the project have
changed, it is easy to simply
<a href="project_modify.html">modify the project's properties</a>.</p>
