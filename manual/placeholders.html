<p>A very powerfull feature of TeXnicCenter are placeholders. They are
used on occasions when values or commands need to be specified, that will
change dynamically during runtime. This feature allows the user a very flexible
configuration of TeXnicCenter, because command line arguments, DDE-commands or
other values do not have to be specified statically, but will be dynamically
generated by TeXnicCenter when needed.</p>

<p>Placeholders are a kind of variable. The user just specifies the name
of the variable and TeXnicCenter sets the variables value dynamically
and replaces its name with the current value, when needed.</p>

<p>There a two types of placeholders in TeXnicCenter:</p>
<p>
<dl>
   <dt><a href="placeholdersingle.html">Placeholders for single files</a></dt>
   <dd>They are often used to define command line arguments and DDE-commands.</dd>

   <dt><a href="placeholdersets.html">Placeholders for sets of files</a></dt>
   <dd>They are used to deal with more than one file at a time.</dd>
</dl>
