<p>TeXnicCenter is an integrated development environment (IDE) for
developing
LaTeX documents on Microsoft Windows (Windows 2000, XP and Vista).</p>
<p>The term IDE means that TeXnicCenter includes many of the
tools needed to develop documents with LaTeX in just one application.
Use the
text editor to write LaTeX files.&nbsp; The TeXnicCenter editor
recognizes many LaTeX constructs and displays them in colors that make
it easier to understand the structure of your documents.<br>
</p>
<p>You can then start the build
process to convert your LaTeX source document into a typeset output by
just choosing a menu
item or pushing a button on the toolbar. The output of the LaTeX
compiler is written to a window and analyzed.&nbsp; It is easy to find
the next or a previous error, warning, or bad box by clicking on
a toolbar icon.&nbsp; Repeating this action will permit you to see as
many of them as you like.<br>
</p>
<p>Viewing the generated output is easy with TeXnicCenter. Just choose
the appropriate menu item and the right viewer application will be
started.&nbsp; Some viewers even support a feature of TeXnicCenter that
causes the output in the viewer to correspond to
the part of the source file where the cursor is presently located.</p>
<p>TeXnicCenter's aim is to support new users of LaTeX by providing the
most
important LaTeX constructs via menu entries, so that users do not have
to remember all the details of syntax.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; the
interface to the
LaTeX compiler and other tools like MakeIndex and BibTeX is handled
automatically:&nbsp; users do not have to remember command-line
parameters.&nbsp;
However, TeXnicCenter also supports experienced users of LaTeX by
providing a powerful, fully customizable and integrated
environment.</p>
