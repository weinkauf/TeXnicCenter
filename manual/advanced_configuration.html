<p>TeXnicCenter provides many configuration options in its dialog boxes and
menus. Hopefully, all the configuration you need is available directly from
TeXnicCenter. Some configuration tasks, however, are too broad or too uncommon
to be supported directly by TeXnicCenter. This section contains advanced
configuration tips and information to handle these special cases.</p>

<p>TeXnicCenter comes with dictionaries for English and German. Dictionaries for
several other languages are available on the Internet.</p>

</p>

<p>The spell checking library used by TeXnicCenter is called <b>MySpell</b>. It
is the same library used by the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Open Office</a> projects. Any MySpell
dictionary available for those applications is compatible with the TeXnicCenter.
The Open Office project has a collection dictionaries supporting several
languages and dialects available for
<a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/download_dictionary.html">download</a>.</p>

<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="h4"><a name="install">How do I install additional spelling dictionaries?</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Each MySpell dictionary consist of two main files. Copy both the affix file,
&quot;language-dialect.aff&quot;, and the dictionary file,
&quot;language-dialect.dic&quot; into the Language directory of your
TeXnicCenter installation. The new dictionary will appear in the
<a href="options_page_spelling.html">'<var>Spelling</var>'</a> option page
immediately, but your new selection will not take affect until after you restarted
TeXnicCenter.</p>

<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="h4"><a name="personal-format">What is the format of the personal dictionary?</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>The personal dictionary format is a simple text file with one case-sensitive
word per line. The first line contains the approximate number of words in the
dictionary. If the first line doesn't contain a valid number, then TeXnicCenter
guesses the size of the word list. Failing to place a blank line or a number as
the first line in the personal dictionary file will cause the first word in the
dictionary to be lost.</p>

<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="h4"><a name="wordlist">Can I use a word list from another application as my
personal dictionary?</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>You may use any word list that is in the <a href="#personal-format">format
accepted by the personal dictionary</a>. You will also need read and write
access to the personal dictionary file.</p>

<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="h4"><a name="spelling-error">How do I correct a spelling error in the dictionary?</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>If the spelling error is in your personal dictionary, open your personal
dictionary file in any text editor and remove or correct the incorrect word.
If you believe you have found a spelling error in the main dictionary, ensure
that the mis-spelling really is an error. First, ensure you have the correct
language and dialect. The dialect determines which spelling of words with
multiple spellings to use. Next, review your
<a href="options_page_spelling.html">language and spelling option settings</a>.
If you still believe that you have found a spelling error in a main dictionary,
you should contact the author or maintainer of the dictionary directly.</p>

<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="h4"><a name="locale">The locale I want to use is not available from the locale
control?</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Most users should find that their preferred locale can safely be selected
from within TeXnicCenter. You can however, explicitly set the locale by
editing TeXnicCenter's registry keys. If you are uncomfortable editing your
registry or you don't know what a registry editor is, you are probably best
off not to continue with this configuration.</p>
<p>It is important that TeXnicCenter not be running during any registry
editing operation. Open the registry key
&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ToolsCenter\TeXnicCenter\Settings\Language\Locale&quot;
with a registry editor. Change the value of this key to your desired locale.
The new locale setting takes affect after you restarted TeXnicCenter.</p>
