  reduces the amount of necessary available disk storage. The simplest way to
  perform a permutation often is to read the records of a data set from a
  source portion of data storage, permute them in memory, and write them to a
  separate target portion of the same size. It can be quite expensive, however,
  to provide disk storage that is twice the size of very large data sets.
  Permuting in place reduces the expense by using only a small amount of extra
  disk storage beyond the size of the data set. \par
  \newcommand{\ceil}[1]{\lceil #1\rceil} \newcommand{\rank}[1]{\mathop{\rm
  rank}\nolimits #1} This paper features in-place algorithms for commonly used
  structured permutations. We have developed an asymptotically optimal
  algorithm for performing BMMC (bit-matrix-multiply/complement) permutations
  in place that requires at most $\frac{2N}{BD}\left(
  2\ceil{\frac{\rank{\gamma}}{\lg (M/B)}} + \frac{7}{2}\right)$ parallel disk
  accesses, as long as $M \geq 2BD$, where $N$ is the number of records in the
  data set, $M$ is the number of records that can fit in memory, $D$ is the
  number of disks, $B$ is the number of records in a block, and $\gamma$ is the
  lower left $\lg (N/B) \times \lg B$ submatrix of the characteristic matrix
  for the permutation. This algorithm uses $N+M$ records of disk storage and
  requires only a constant factor more parallel disk accesses and insignificant
  additional computation than a previously published asymptotically optimal
  algorithm that uses $2N$ records of disk storage. \par We also give
  algorithms to perform mesh and torus permutations on a $d$-dimensional mesh.
  The in-place algorithm for mesh permutations requires at most $3\ceil{N/BD}$
  parallel I/Os and the in-place algorithm for torus permutations uses at most
  $4dN/BD$ parallel I/Os. The algorithms for mesh and torus permutations
  require no extra disk space as long as the memory size $M$ is at least $3BD$.
  The torus algorithm improves upon the previous best algorithm in terms of
  both time and space.}

  der  Anwendung von Patterns in der Analysephase der Softwareentwicklung.
  In der Designphase werden Patterns seit einigen Jahren
  eingesetzt, um Expertenwissen und Wiederverwendbarkeit

  Es existiert bereits eine Fülle an solchen Design Patterns.
  Die Analysephase ist ein neuer Anwendungsbereich für Patterns, der
  bisher in der Literatur noch nicht ausreichend behandelt wurde.
  In dieser Arbeit wird die Anwendung des Pattern-Ansatzes in der 
  Analysephase aufgearbeitet und konkretisiert. Analyse Patterns unterstützen
  den gesamten Softwareentwicklungsprozeß und helfen
  bekannte Probleme während der Analysephase zu lösen. Dadurch können 
  Zeit und Kosten bei der Entwicklung neuer Softwaresysteme eingespart werden.
  Diese Eigenschaften von Analyse Patterns werden anhand
  konkreter Beispiele in einer Case Study nachgewiesen. Diese Case Study 
  beschreibt den Einsatz von in dieser Arbeit entwickelten Analyse Pattern
  für Informationsmanagement anhand des Projekts Virtuelle Universität 
  der Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, in dem ein Internet-Informationsbroker 
  zur Unterstützung von Lehre und Forschung realisiert wird.
  Die Erfahrungen aus diesem Projekt werden untersucht, und
  die Auswirkungen der Analyse Patterns auf Wiederverwendung bei der 
  Softwareentwicklung und auf die Akzeptanz des resultierenden

  The purpose of this article is twofold, first to promote the use of patterns

  process from the requirements analysis to the analysis model and further 
  on to its transformation into a flexible design. Second we present, as 
  an example, a family of analysis patterns that deal with a series of 
  pressing problems in cooperative work, collaborative information filtering 
  and sharing, and knowledge management. We present the step-by-step 
  evolution of the analysis pattern virtual library with active

  ABSTRACT = {
    Using design patterns is a widely accepted method to improve software
    development. There are many benefits of the application of patterns claimed
    in the literature. The most cited claim is that design patterns can provide
    a common design vocabulary and therefore improve greatly communication
    between software designers. Most of the claims are supported by experiences
    reports of practitioners, but there is a lack of quantitative research
    concerning the actual application of design patterns and about the
    realization of the claimed benefits. In this paper we analyze the
    development process of over 1000 open source software projects using
    version control information. We explore this information to gain an insight
    into the differences of software development with and without design
    patterns. By analyzing these differences we provide evidence that design
    patterns are used for communication and that there is a significant
    difference between developers who use design patterns and who do not.

  untersuchten bisher Produktgruppen wie CDs und Bücher.  In dieser Studie
  beschäftigen wir uns mit dem bisher noch nicht untersuchten
  Spieleeinzelhandel und konzentrieren uns dabei auf den österreichischen
  Markt. Es soll untersucht werden, ob der österreichische Markt ähnliche oder
  andere Ergebnisse liefert als die bisher untersuchten Märkte (hauptsächlich
  im nordamerikanischer Raum).  Die Untersuchung zeigt folgendes: Die Preise
  für Spiele sind im elektronischen Markt um ca. 20 Prozent niedriger als im
  traditionellen Markt.  Die Preisstreuungen im elektronischen und
  traditionellen Markt unterscheiden sich nicht signifikant.  Beide Ergebnisse
  decken sich mit den Ergebnissen anderer Studien. Damit ist der
  österreichische Online-Brettspieleinzelhandel ähnlich entwickelt wie der
  Online-Handel in anderen Ländern und für andere Produktgruppen.

  In this paper we develop an alternative to minimum support which utilizes
  knowledge of the process which generates transaction data and allows for
  highly skewed frequency distributions. We apply a simple stochastic model
  (the NB model), which is known for its usefulness to describe item
  occurrences in transaction data, to develop a frequency constraint. This
  model-based frequency constraint is used together with a precision threshold
  to find individual support thresholds for groups of associations. We develop
  the notion of NB-frequent itemsets and present two mining algorithms which
  find all NB-frequent itemsets in a database. In experiments with publicly
  available transaction databases we show that the new constraint can provide
  significant improvements over a single minimum support threshold and that the
  precision threshold is easier to use.

  Mining association rules is an important technique for discovering meaningful

  of algorithms to mine associations are discussed in great detail. In this
  paper we investigate properties of transaction data sets from a probabilistic
  point of view. We present a simple probabilistic framework for transaction
  data and its implementation using the R statistical computing environment.
  The framework can be used to simulate transaction data when no associations
  are present. We use such data to explore the ability to filter noise of
  confidence and lift, two popular interest measures used for rule mining.
  Based on the framework we develop the measure hyperlift and we compare this
  new measure to lift using simulated data and a real-world grocery database.

  abstract = {The I/O access patterns of many parallel applications consist of
  accesses to a large number of small, noncontiguous pieces of data. If an
  application's I/O needs are met by making many small, distinct I/O requests,
  however, the I/O performance degrades drastically. To avoid this problem,
  MPI-IO allows users to access noncontiguous data with a single I/O function
  call, unlike in Unix I/O. In this paper, we explain how critical this feature
  of MPI-IO is for high performance and how it enables implementations to
  perform optimizations. We first provide a classification of the different
  ways of expressing an application's I/O needs in MPI-IO---we classify them
  into four {\em levels}, called level~0 through level~3. We demonstrate that,
  for applications with noncontiguous access patterns, the I/O performance
  improves dramatically if users write their applications to make level-3
  requests (noncontiguous, collective) rather than level-0 requests (Unix
  style). We then describe how our MPI-IO implementation, ROMIO, delivers high
  performance for noncontiguous requests. We explain in detail the two key
  optimizations ROMIO performs: data sieving for noncontiguous requests from
  one process and collective I/O for noncontiguous requests from multiple
  processes. We describe how we have implemented these optimizations portably
  on multiple machines and file systems, controlled their memory requirements,
  and also achieved high performance. We demonstrate the performance and
  portability with performance results for three applications---an
  astrophysics-application template (DIST3D), the NAS BTIO benchmark, and an
  unstructured code (UNSTRUC)---on five different parallel machines: HP
  Exemplar, IBM SP, Intel Paragon, NEC SX-4, and SGI Origin2000.}

  moved up and performed asynchronously with other computation. 2) Parallel
  execution of I/O statements: {\em if} all sizes are known at compile time,
  the compiler can insert seeks so that processes can access the file

  skipping by the maximum and leaving holes in the file, and they claim that

  Really all this is saying is that fixed-width fields are good for
  parallelism, and that compilers could take advantage of them.}

                   performance could be achieved from integrating multiple

  TITLE = {Space Efficient Mining of Multigraph Streams},
  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {
  The challenge of monitoring massive amounts of data generated by
  communication networks has led to the interest in data stream
  processing. 
  We study streams of edges in massive communication multigraphs, defined by
  (source, destination) pairs. 
  The goal is to compute properties of the underlying graph while using small
  space (much smaller than the number of communicants), 
  and to avoid bias introduced because some edges may appear many times,
  while others are seen only once. 
  We give results for three fundamental problems on multigraph degree sequences: 
  estimating frequency moments of degrees, finding the heavy hitter
  degrees, and computing range sums of degree values. 
  In all cases we are able to show space bounds
  for our summarizing algorithms
  that are significantly smaller than storing complete information.
  We use a variety of data stream methods: 
  sketches, sampling, hashing and distinct
  counting, but a common feature is that we use the novel approach of
  {\em cascaded summaries}: nesting multiple estimation techniques within one
  another. 
  In our experimental study, we see that such summaries are highly
  effective, enabling massive multigraph streams to be effectively
  summarized to answer queries of interest with high accuracy using only
  a small amount of space. }

  TITLE = {Holistic Aggregates in a Networked World: 
                   Distributed Tracking of Approximate Quantiles},
  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {
  While traditional database systems optimize for performance on
  one-shot queries, emerging large-scale monitoring applications
  require continuous tracking of  complex aggregates  and
  data-distribution summaries over collections of
  physically-distributed streams.
  Thus, effective solutions have to be simultaneously space efficient
  (at each remote site), communication efficient (across the underlying
  communication network), and provide continuous, guaranteed-quality
  estimates.
  In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions
  for the problem of continuously tracking complex holistic
  aggregates in such a distributed-streams setting ---
  our primary focus is on approximate quantile summaries, but our
  approach is more broadly applicable and can handle other
  holistic-aggregate functions (e.g., ``heavy-hitters'' queries).
  We present the first known distributed-tracking schemes  for
  maintaining accurate quantile estimates  with provable
  approximation guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing
the storage space at each remote site as well as the
communication cost across the network.
In a nutshell, our algorithms employ a combination
of local tracking at remote sites and simple prediction
models for local site behavior in order to produce highly
communication- and space-efficient solutions.
We perform extensive experiments with real and synthetic data
to explore the various tradeoffs and understand the role of
prediction models in our schemes.
The results clearly validate our approach, revealing significant
savings over naive solutions as well as our analytical worst-case
guarantees.}

  TITLE = {Summarizing and Mining Skewed Data Streams},
  YEAR = {2005},
  URL = {../cmz-sdm.pdf},
  ABSTRACT = {
Many applications generate massive data streams.
Summarizing such massive data requires fast, small space algorithms to
support post-hoc queries and mining. 
An important observation is that such streams are rarely uniform, and
real data sources typically exhibit significant skewness. 
These are well modeled by Zipf distributions, which are characterized
by a parameter, $z$, that captures the amount of skew.

We present a data stream summary that can answer point queries with 
$eps$ accuracy and show that the space needed is only
$O(eps^{-\min\{1,1/z\}})$. 
This is the first $o(1/eps)$ space algorithm for this problem,
and we show it is essentially tight for skewed distributions. 
We show that the same data structure can also estimate the $L_2$ norm
of the stream in $o(1/eps^2)$ space for $z>1/2$, another
improvement over the existing $\Omega(1/eps^2)$ methods. 

We support our theoretical results with an experimental study over a
large variety of real and synthetic data. 
We show that significant skew is present in both textual and
telecommunication data.
Our methods give strong accuracy, significantly better than other
methods, and behave exactly in line with their analytic bounds.}

                   (ICDE)},
  URL = {../bquant.pdf},
  ABSTRACT = {
Skew is prevalent in many data sources such as IP traffic
streams.  To continually summarize the 
distribution of such data, a high-biased set of quantiles
(e.g., 50th, 90th and 99th percentiles) with finer error
guarantees at higher ranks (e.g., errors of 5, 1 and 0.1
percent, respectively) is more useful than uniformly 
distributed quantiles (e.g., 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles)
with uniform error guarantees.
In this paper, we address the following two problems.  
First, can we compute quantiles with finer 
error guarantees for the higher ranks of the data distribution 
effectively, using less space and computation time than 
computing all quantiles uniformly at the finest error?
Second, if {\em specific\/} quantiles and their error bounds 
are requested {\em a priori}, can the necessary space usage and 
computation time be reduced?

We answer both questions in the affirmative by formalizing them as the
``high-biased'' quantiles and the ``targeted'' quantiles problems,
respectively, and presenting algorithms with provable guarantees, that 
perform
significantly better than previously known solutions for these problems.  
We implemented our algorithms in the Gigascope data stream management
system, and evaluated alternate approaches for maintaining the
relevant summary structures.  Our experimental results on real and
synthetic IP data streams complement our theoretical analyses, and
highlight the importance of lightweight, non-blocking implementations
when maintaining summary structures over high-speed data streams.}

  ABSTRACT = {
We initiate a new class of string matching problems called 
{\em  Substring Compression Problems}.
Given a string $S$ that may be preprocessed, 
the problem is to quickly find the
compressed representation or the compressed size of any query substring of 
$S$ 
(Substring Compression Query or SCQ) or to find the length $\ell$ 
substring of $S$ 
whose compressed size is the least (Least Compressible Substring or LCS 
problem). 

Starting from the seminal paper of Lempel and Ziv over 25 years ago,
many different methods have emerged for compressing entire strings.
Determining substring compressibility is a natural variant that is
combinatorially and algorithmically challenging, yet surprisingly
has not been studied before. In addition, compressibility of strings
is emerging as a tool to compare biological sequences and analyze their
information content. However, typically, the compressibility 
of the entire sequence is not as informative as that of portions of
the sequences. Thus substring compressibility may be a more suitable 
basis for sequence analysis.

We present the first known, nearly optimal algorithms for substring 
compression problems---SCQ, LCS and their generaliztions---that 
are exact or provably approximate. 
Our exact algorithms exploit the structure in strings via suffix trees  
and 
our approximate algorithms rely on new relationships we find between 
Lempel-Ziv compression and string parsings. }

  BOOKTITLE = {Proceedings of SIGMOD},
  PAGES = {155--166},
  URL = {../ckmsh4.pdf},
  ABSTRACT = {
  Data items archived in data warehouses or those that arrive online as
streams typically have attributes which take values from multiple
hierarchies (e.g., time and geographic location; source and
destination IP addresses). Providing an aggregate view of such data is
important to summarize, visualize, and analyze. We develop the
aggregate view based on certain hierarchically organized sets of
large-valued regions (``heavy hitters''). Such Hierarchical Heavy
Hitters (HHHs) were previously introduced as a crucial aggregation
technique in one dimension. In order to analyze the wider range of
data warehousing applications and realistic IP data streams, we
generalize this problem to multiple dimensions.

We illustrate and study two variants of HHHs for multi-dimensional
data. In particular, we identify ``overlap'' and ``split'' variants,
depending on how an aggregate computed for a child node in the
multi-dimensional hierarchy is propagated to its parent
element(s). For data warehousing applications, we present offline
algorithms that take multiple passes over the data and produce the
exact HHHs.  For data stream applications, we present online
algorithms that find approximate HHHs in one pass, with proven
accuracy guarantees.

We show experimentally, using real and synthetic data, that our
proposed online algorithms yield outputs which are very similar
(virtually identical, in many cases) to their offline
counterparts. The lattice property of the product of hierarchical
dimensions (``diamond'') is crucially exploited in our online
algorithms to track approximate HHHs using only a small, fixed number
of statistics per candidate node, regardless of the number of
dimensions.}

Many algorithms have been proposed to approximate holistic ag-

However, little work has been done to explore what techniques are

In this paper, we study the performance implications of using
user-dened aggregate functions (UDAFs) to incorporate selection-
based and sketch-based algorithms for holistic aggregates into a
data stream management system's query processing architecture.
We identify key performance bottlenecks and tradeoffs, and pro-
pose novel techniques to make these holistic UDAFs fast and space-
efcient for use in high-speed data stream applications. We evalu-
ate performance using generated and actual IP packet data, focus-
ing on approximating quantiles and heavy hitters. The best of our
current implementations can process streaming queries at OC48

One of the important statistics is that of the 'hot items' in the relation: those that appear many times (most frequently, or more than some threshold). For example, end-biased histograms keep the hot items as part of the histogram and are used in selectivity estimation. Hot items are used as simple outliers in data mining, and in anomaly detection in networking applications. We present a new algorithm for dynamically determining the hot items at any time in the relation that is undergoing deletion operations as well as inserts. Our algorithm maintains a small space data structure that monitors the transactions on the relation, and when required, quickly outputs all hot items, without rescanning the relation in the database. With user-specified probability, it is able to report all hot items. Our algorithm relies on the idea of ``group testing'', is simple to implement, and has provable quality, space and time guarantees. Previously known algorithms for this problem that make similar quality and performance guarantees can not handle deletions, and those that handle deletions can not make similar guarantees without rescanning the database. Our experiments with real and synthetic data shows that our algorithm is remarkably accurate in dynamically tracking the hot items independent of the rate of insertions and deletions.}

The problem we study in this paper is that of finding Hierarchical Heavy Hitters (HHH): given a hierarchy and a fraction phi, we want to find all HHH nodes that have a total number of descendants in the data stream larger than phi of the total number of elements in the data stream, after discounting the descendant nodes that are HHH nodes. The resulting summary gives a topological 'cartogram' of the hierarchical data. We present deterministic and randomized algorithms for finding HHHs, which builds upon existing techniques by incorporating the hierarchy into the algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate several factors of improvement in accuracy over the straightforward approach, which is due to making algorithms hierarchy-aware}

  ABSTRACT = {
There is much focus in the algorithms and database communities on
designing tools to manage and mine data streams.
Typically, data streams consist of multiple signals.
Formally, a stream of multiple signals is $(i,a_{i,j})$
where $i$'s correspond to the domain, $j$'s index the different
signals and $a_{i,j}\geq 0$ give the value of the $j$th signal at
point $i$.
We study the problem of finding norms that are cumulative of
the multiple signals in the data stream.

For example, consider the max-dominance norm,
defined as $\Sigma_i \max_j \{a_{i,j}\}$.
It may be thought as estimating the norm of the  ``upper
envelope'' of the multiple signals, or alternatively, as
estimating the norm of the ``marginal'' distribution of tabular data streams.
It is used in applications to estimate the ``worst case influence'' of
multiple processes, for example in IP traffic analysis, electrical
grid monitoring and
financial domain.
In addition, it is a natural measure, generalizing the union of data
streams or counting distinct elements in data streams.

We present the first known data stream algorithms for estimating
max-dominance of multiple signals.
In particular, we use workspace and time-per-item that are both sublinear (in
fact, poly-logarithmic)  in the input size.  In contrast
other
notions of dominance on streams $a$, $b$ --- min-dominance
($\Sigma_i \min_j \{a_{i,j}\}$),
count-dominance ($|\{i | a_i > b_i\}|$) or relative-dominance
($\Sigma_i a_i/\max\{1,b_i\}$ ) --- are all impossible to estimate
accurately with sublinear space.}

  ABSTRACT = {
Massive data streams are now fundamental to many data processing
applications.  For example, Internet routers produce large scale
diagnostic data streams.  Such streams are rarely stored in
traditional databases, and instead must be processed ``on the fly'' as
they are produced.  Similarly, sensor networks produce multiple data
streams of observations from their sensors.  There is growing focus on
manipulating  data streams, and hence, there is a need to identify
basic operations of interest in managing data streams, and to support
them efficiently.
We propose computation of the Hamming norm as a basic operation of
interest.  The Hamming norm formalizes ideas
that are used throughout data processing.
When applied to a single stream, the Hamming norm gives the number of distinct 
items that are
present in that data stream, which is a statistic of great interest in
databases.  When applied to a pair of streams, the Hamming norm gives
an important measure of (dis)similarity:  the number of unequal item
counts in the two streams. Hamming norms have many uses
in comparing data streams.

We present a novel approximation technique for estimating the Hamming norm
for massive data streams; this relies on what we call the ``$l_0$
{\it sketch}''
and we prove its accuracy. We test our approximation method on a large
quantity of synthetic and real stream data, and show that the
estimation is accurate to within a few percentage points.

For example, consider the geographic distribution of cell
phone traffic at different  base stations across the
country
(which can be  represented by a table indexed by
  latitude and longitude),
or the evolution of traffic at Internet
routers over time
(which can be represented by a table
indexed by time, source and destination IP addresses).
Detecting similarity patterns in such data
sets (e.g., which geographic regions have similar cell phone
usage  distribution,  which  IP subnet traffic distributions
over time intervals are similar,  etc) is of great importance.
Identification   of  such  patterns  poses  many
conceptual challenges (what is a  suitable  similarity
distance  function  for two ``regions'') as well as
technical challenges (how to perform similarity computations
efficiently as massive tables get accumulated over time) that
we address.

We  present methods  for  determining
similar regions in massive tabular data.
Our methods are for computing the ``distance'' between
any two subregions of a tabular data: they are approximate,
but  highly  accurate as we prove mathematically, and they are
fast, running in time nearly linear in the table size. Our methods
are general since these distance computations can be
applied to any  mining or
similarity   algorithms that use $L_p$ norms.
A novelty of our distance computation procedures is that they
work for any $L_p$ norms --- not only the traditional
$p=2$  or  $p=1$,  but for all $p\leq 2$; the choice of $p$,
say {\em fractional} $p$,
provides an interesting alternative similarity behavior!
We use  our algorithms in  a  detailed
experimental study of the clustering patterns in  real  tabular
data obtained  from  one  of  AT\&T's  data stores and show that our
methods  are  substantially  faster   than   straightforward
methods  while remaining highly accurate, and able to detect
interesting patterns by varying the value of $p$.}

  ABSTRACT = {
The edit distance between two strings $S$ and $R$
is defined to be the minimum number of character inserts,
deletes and changes needed to convert $R$ to $S$.
Given a text string $t$ of length $n$, and a pattern string $p$
of length $m$, informally, the string edit distance matching problem is to
compute the smallest edit distance between $p$ and
substrings of $t$. A well known dynamic programming algorithm
takes time $O(nm)$ to solve this problem, and it is an important
open problem in Combinatorial Pattern Matching to
significantly improve this bound.

We relax the problem
so that (a) we allow an additional operation, namely,
{\em substring moves}, and (b) we approximate the string edit distance
upto a factor of $O(\log n \log^* n)$.\footnote{$\log^* n$ is the
number of times $\log$ function is applied to $n$ to produce a constant.}
Our result is a near linear time deterministic
algorithm for this version of the problem.
This is the first
known significantly subquadratic algorithm for a string
edit distance problem in which the distance involves
nontrivial alignments.
Our results are obtained by embedding strings into $L_1$
vector space using a simplified parsing technique we call
{\em Edit Sensitive Parsing} (ESP). This embedding is
approximately distance preserving, and we show many applications
of this embedding to string proximity problems including nearest neighbors,
outliers, and streaming computations with strings.

  ABSTRACT = {
If the genetic maps of two species are modelled as permutations of
 (homologous) genes, the number of chromosomal rearrangements
 in the form of deletions, block moves, inversions etc. to transform one
 such permutation to another can be used as a measure of their evolutionary
 distance. Motivated by such scenarios in Computational Biology and
elsewhere, we study problems of
computing distances between permutations
 as well as matching permutations in
 sequences, and finding most similar permutation from a collection
 (``nearest neighbor'').

We adopt a
 general approach: embed permutation distances of relevance into well-known
 vector spaces in an approximately distance-preserving manner,
 and solve the resulting problems on the well-known spaces.
Our results are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
We present the first known approximately distance preserving
embeddings of these permutation distances into well-known spaces.
\item
Using these embeddings, we obtain several results, including
the first known efficient
 solution for approximately solving nearest neighbor
 problems with permutations
 and
the first known
 algorithms for finding permutation distances in the ``data stream''
 model.
\item
We consider a novel
 class of problems called {\em permutation matching} problems
which are similar to string matching problems,
except that the
pattern is a permutation (rather than a string)
and present linear or near-linear time
algorithms for approximately solving permutation matching problems;
in contrast, the corresponding string problems take significantly
longer.

We have two users, $A$ and $B$, who hold documents $x$ and $y$ respectively.
Neither of the users has any information about the other's document.
They exchange messages
 so that $B$ computes $x$; it may be required that $A$ compute
 $y$ as well.
Our goal is to design communication protocols with
 the main objective of minimizing the total number of bits they exchange;
 other objectives are
 minimizing the number of rounds and the complexity of internal
 computations.
An important notion which determines the efficiency of the
 protocols is how one measures the distance between $x$ and $y$.
We consider several metrics for measuring this distance,
 namely the Hamming metric, the Levenshtein metric (edit distance),
 and a new LZ metric, which is introduced in this paper.
We show how to estimate the distance between $x$ and $y$ using a
 single message of logarithmic size.
For each metric, we present the first
 communication-efficient protocols, which often
 match the corresponding lower bounds.
A consequence of these are error-correcting codes for these error
 models which correct up to $d$ errors in $n$ characters using
 $O(d \log n)$ bits.
Our most interesting methods use a new
 {\em histogram transformation} that we introduce to convert
 edit distance to $L_1$ distance.}

Electronic Book is an application with a multimedia database of instructional resources, which include hyperlinked text, instructor's audio/video clips, slides, animation, still images, etc. as well as content-based infomration about these data, and metadata such as annotations, tags, and cross-referencing information. Electronic books in the Internet or on CDs today are not easy to learn from. We propose the use of a multimedia database of instructional resources in constructing and delivering multimedia lessons about topics in an electronic book.

We introduce an electronic book data model containing (a) topic objects and and (b) instructional resources, called instruction modules which are multimedia presentations possibly capturing real-life lectures of instructors. We use the notion of topic prerequisites for topics at different detail levels, to allow electronic book users to request / compose multimedia lessons about topics on the electronic book. We present automated construction of the ''best'' user-tailored lesson (as a multimedia presentation). }

  TITLE = {Estimating Articulatory Parameters from the Acoustic

  SCHOOL = {The Centre for Speech Technology Research, Edinburgh
                   University},

  ABSTRACT = {A successful method for inferring articulation from the
acoustic speech signal would find many applications: low bit-rate
speech coding, visual representation of speech, and the possibility of
improved automatic speech recognition to name but a few.  It is
unsurprising, therefore, that researchers have been investigating the
acoustic-to-articulatory inversion mapping for several decades now.

A great variety of approaches and models have been applied to the
problem.  Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of these attempts
have faced difficulties in satisfactorily assessing performance in
terms of genuine human articulation.  However, technologies such as
electromagnetic articulography (EMA) mean that measurement of human
articulation during speech has become increasingly accessible.
Crucially, a large corpus of acoustic-articulatory data during
phonetically-diverse, continuous speech has recently been recorded at
Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh.  One of the primary motivations of
this thesis is to exploit the availability of this remarkable
resource.

Among the data-driven models which have been employed in previous
studies, the feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) in particular has
been used several times with promising results.  Researchers have
cited advantages in terms of memory requirement and execution speed as
a significant factor motivating their use.  Furthermore, the MLP is
well known as a universal function approximator; an MLP of suitable
form can in theory represent any arbitrary mapping function.
Therefore, using an MLP in conjunction with the relatively large
quantities of acoustic-articulatory data arguably represents a
promising and useful first research step for the current thesis, and a
significant part of this thesis is occupied with doing this.

Having demonstrated an MLP which performs well enough to provide a
reasonable baseline, we go on to critically evaluate the suitability
of the MLP for the inversion mapping.  The aim is to find ways to
improve modelling accuracy further.  Considering what model of the
target articulatory domain is provided in the MLP is key in this
respect.  It has been shown that the outputs of an MLP trained with
the sum-of-squares error function approximate the mean of the target
data points conditioned on the input vector.  In many situations, this
is an appropriate and sufficient solution.  In other cases, however,
this conditional mean is an inconveniently limiting model of data in
the target domain, particularly for ill-posed problems where the
mapping may be multi-valued.

Substantial evidence exists which shows that multiple articulatory
configurations are able to produce the same acoustic signal.  This
means that a system intended to map from a point in acoustic space can
be faced with multiple candidate articulatory configurations.
Therefore, despite the impressive ability of the MLP to model mapping
functions, it may prove inadequate in certain respects for performing
the acoustic-to-articulatory inversion mapping.  Mixture density
networks (MDN) provide a principled method to model arbitrary
probability density functions over the target domain, conditioned on
the input vector.  In theory, therefore, the MDN offers a superior
model of the target domain compared to the MLP.  We hypothesise that
this advantage will prove beneficial in the case of the
acoustic-to-articulatory inversion mapping.  Accordingly, this thesis
aims to test this hypothesis and directly compare the performance of
MDN with MLP on exactly the same acoustic-to-articulatory inversion
task.},

  ABSTRACT = {In sequential prediction tasks, one repeatedly tries to predict the next element in a sequence. A classical way to solve these problems is to fit an order-n Markov model to the data, but fixed-order models are often bigger than they need to be. In a fixed-order model, all predictors are of length n, even if a shorter predictor would work just as well. We present a greedy algorithm, vpr, for finding variable-length predictive rules. Although vpr is not optimal, we show that on English text, it performs similarly to fixed-order models but uses fewer parameters. },

  ABSTRACT = {Because uncertain reasoning is often intractable, it is hard to reason with a large amount of knowledge. One solution to this problem is to specify a set of possible models, some simple and some complex, and choose which to use based on the problem. We present an architecture for interpreting temporal data, called AIID, that incrementally constructs belief networks based on data that arrives asynchronously. It synthesizes the opportunistic control of the blackboard architecture with recent work on constructing belief networks from fragments. We have implemented this architecture in the domain of military analysis. },

  ABSTRACT = {Agents need to know the effects of their actions.  Strong associations between actions and effects can be found by counting how often they co-occur.We present an algorithm that learns temporal patterns expressed as \emph{fluents}, propositions with temporal extent. The fluent-learning algorithm is hierarchical and unsupervised.   It works by maintaining co-occurrence statistics on pairs of fluents. In experiments on a mobile robot, the fluent-learning algorithm found temporal associations that correspond to effects of the robot's actions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Conditional random fields (CRFs) for sequence modeling have several advantages over joint models such as HMMs, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models, and the ability to incorporate arbitrary overlapping features. Previous work has focused on linear-chain CRFs, which correspond to finite-state machines, and have efficient exact inference algorithms. Often, however, we wish to label sequence data in multiple interacting ways---for example, performing part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase segmentation simultaneously, increasing joint accuracy by sharing information between them. We present dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs), which are CRFs in which each time slice has a set of state variables and edges---a distributed state representation as in dynamic Bayesian networks---and parameters are tied across slices. (They could also be called conditionally trained Dynamic Markov Networks.) Since exact inference can be intractable in these models, we perform approximate inference using the tree-based reparameterization framework (TRP). We also present empirical results comparing DCRFs with linear-chain CRFs on natural-language data. },

  ABSTRACT = {In sequence modeling, we often wish to represent complex interaction between
labels, such as when performing multiple, cascaded labeling tasks on the
same sequence, or when long-range dependencies exist.
We present dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs), a 
generalization of linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs)
in which each time slice contains a set of state variables and 
edges---a distributed state representation as in dynamic Bayesian 
networks (DBNs)---and parameters are tied across slices.  Since 
exact inference can be intractable in such models, we perform 
approximate inference using several schedules for belief propagation, 
including tree-based reparameterization (TRP).  On a natural-language 
chunking task, we show that a DCRF performs better than a series of 
linear-chain CRFs, achieving comparable performance using only half 
the training data.

  ABSTRACT = { Learning Markov random field (MRF) models is
notoriously hard due to the presence of a global
normalization factor. In this paper we present a
new framework for learning MRF models based
on the contrastive free energy (CF) objective
function. In this scheme the parameters are updated
in an attempt to match the average statistics
of the data distribution and a distribution which
is (partially or approximately) "relaxed" to the
equilibrium distribution. We show that maximum
likelihood, mean field, contrastive divergence
and pseudo-likelihood objectives can be
understood in this paradigm. Moreover, we propose
and study a new learning algorithm: the "kstep
Kikuchi/Bethe approximation". This algorithm
is then tested on a conditional random field
model with "skip-chain" edges to model long
range interactions in text data. It is demonstrated
that with no loss in accuracy, the training time is
brought down from 19 hours (BP based learning)
to 83 minutes, an order of magnitude improvement. }

  abstract =     "Record-keeping and decision-making in industry and
                 government are increasingly based on data stored in
                 computer processable databases. Thus the need for
                 improved computer technology for building, managing,
                 and using these databases is clearly evident. This need
                 is particularly acute in a complex society where the
                 interrelationships among various aspects of the society
                 must be identified and represented. The data which must
                 be used to represent these relationships are growing
                 more complex in nature and becoming greater in size.
                 Furthermore, the increasing on-line use of computer
                 systems and the proliferation and mass introduction of
                 multilevel secondary storage suggests that future
                 computer systems will be primarily oriented toward
                 database management. The large size of future on-line
                 databases will require the computer system to manage
                 local as well as physical resources. The management of
                 logical resources is concerned with the organization,
                 access, update, storage, and sharing of the data and
                 programs in the database. In addition, the sharing of
                 data means that the database system must be capable of
                 providing privacy protection and of controlling access
                 to the users' data. The term {\em data\/} is
                 interpreted broadly to include textual, numeric, and
                 signal data as well as data found in structured
                 records.\par

                 The aim of {\em ACM Transactions on Database Systems\/}
                 (TODS) is to serve as a focal point for an integrated
                 dissemination of database research and development on
                 storage and processor hardware, system software,
                 applications, information science, information
                 analysis, and file management. These areas are
                 particularly relevant to the following ACM Special
                 Interest Groups: Business Data Processing (SIGBDP),
                 Information Retrieval (SIGIR), and Management of Data
                 (SIGMOD). TODS will also embrace parts of the

                 tree. Threats to the encipherment of $B$-trees,

                 paging mechanisms, and on files related to the
                 enciphered index are discussed. Many of the concepts

                 these designs, the orthogonal layout allows an order of

                 are tightly coupled by means of an average message
                 delay constraint. The objective is to allocate copies
                 of information files to network nodes and capacities to
                 network links so that a minimum cost is achieved
                 subject to network delay and file availability
                 constraints. A model for solving the problem is
                 formulated and the resulting optimization problem is
                 shown to fall into a class of nonlinear integer
                 programming problems. Deterministic techniques for
                 solving this class of problems are computationally

                 involves two important components--the unambiguous
                 specification of the restructuring operations and the
                 realization of these operations in a software system.
                 This paper is directed to the first component in the
                 belief that a precise specification will provide a firm
                 foundation for the development of restructuring
                 algorithms and, subsequently, their implementation. The
                 paper completely defines the semantics of the
                 restructuring of tree structured databases.\par

                 The delineation of the restructuring function is
                 accomplished by formulating three different levels of
                 abstraction, with each level of abstraction
                 representing successively more detailed semantics of
                 the function.\par

                 At the first level of abstraction, the schema
                 modification, three types are identified--naming,
                 combining, and relating; these three types are further
                 divided into eight schema operations. The second level
                 of abstraction, the instance operations, constitutes
                 the transformations on the data instances; they are
                 divided into group operations such as replication,
                 factoring, union, etc., and group relation operations
                 such as collapsing, refinement, fusion, etc. The final
                 level, the item value operations, includes the actual

                 create a null value.",

                 users to share data, while retaining the ability to
                 restrict data access. There must be a mechanism to
                 provide protection and security, permitting information
                 to be accessed only by properly authorized users.
                 Further, when tables or restricted views of tables are
                 created and destroyed dynamically, the granting,
                 authentication, and revocation of authorization to use
                 them must also be dynamic. Each of these issues and
                 their solutions in the context of the relational
                 database management system System R are discussed.
                 \par

                 When a database user creates a table, he is fully and
                 solely authorized to perform upon it actions such as
                 read, insert, update, and delete. He may explicitly
                 grant to any other user any or all of his privileges on
                 the table. In addition he may specify that that user is
                 authorized to further grant these privileges to still
                 other users. The result is a directed graph of granted
                 privileges originating from the table creator.\par

                 At some later time a user A may revoke some or all of
                 the privileges which he previously granted to another
                 user B. This action usually revokes the entire subgraph
                 of the grants originating from A's grant to B. It may
                 be, however, that B will still possess the revoked
                 privileges by means of a grant from another user C, and
                 therefore some or all of B's grants should not be
                 revoked. This problem is discussed in detail, and an
                 algorithm for detecting exactly which of B's grants

                 be simply and efficiently stored. Second, since all

                 no longer adequate to deal with the complex problems
                 faced by the modern policymaker. Thus systems must be
                 developed to provide the information and analysis
                 necessary for the decisions which must be made. These
                 systems are called decision support systems. Although
                 database systems provide a key ingredient to decision
                 support systems, the problems now facing the
                 policymaker are different from those problems to which
                 database systems have been applied in the past. The
                 problems are usually not known in advance, they are
                 constantly changing, and answers are needed quickly.
                 Hence additional technologies, methodologies, and
                 approaches must expand the traditional areas of
                 database and operating systems research (as well as
                 other software and hardware research) in order for them
                 to become truly effective in supporting policymakers.

                 This paper describes recent work in this area and
                 indicates where future work is needed. Specifically the
                 paper discusses: (1) why there exists a vital need for
                 decision support systems; (2) examples from work in the
                 field of energy which make explicit the characteristics
                 which distinguish these decision support systems from
                 traditional operational and managerial systems; (3) how
                 an awareness of decision support systems has evolved,
                 including a brief review of work done by others and a
                 statement of the computational needs of decision
                 support systems which are consistent with contemporary
                 technology; (4) an approach which has been made to meet
                 many of these computational needs through the
                 development and implementation of a computational
                 facility, the Generalized Management Information System

  abstract =     "The emergence of a database technology in recent years
                 has focused interest on the subject of data models. A
                 data model is the class of logical data structures
                 which a computer system or language makes available to
                 the user for the purpose of formulating data processing
                 applications. The diversity of computer systems and
                 languages has resulted in a corresponding diversity of
                 data models, and has created a problem for the user in
                 selecting a data model which is in some sense
                 appropriate to a given application. An evaluation
                 procedure is needed which will allow the user to
                 evaluate alternative models in the context of a
                 specific set of applications. This paper takes a first
                 step toward such a procedure by identifying the
                 attributes of a data model which can be used as
                 criteria for evaluating the model. Two kinds of
                 criteria are presented: use criteria, which measure the
                 usability of the model; and implementation criteria,
                 which measure the implementability of the model and the
                 efficiency of the resulting implementation. The use of
                 the criteria is illustrated by applying them to three
                 specific models: an $n$-ary relational model, a
                 hierarchic model, and a network model.",

  abstract =     "A database system can generally be divided into three
                 major components. One component supports the logical
                 database as seen by the user. Another component maps
                 the information into physical records. The third
                 component, called the storage component, is responsible
                 for mapping these records onto auxiliary storage
                 (generally disks) and controlling their transfer to and
                 from main storage.\par

                 This paper is primarily concerned with the
                 implementation of a storage component. It considers a
                 simple and classical interface to the storage
                 component: Seen at this level the database is a
                 collection of segments. Each segment is a linear
                 address space.\par

                 A recovery scheme is first proposed for system failure
                 (hardware or software error which causes the contents
                 of main storage to be lost). It is based on maintaining
                 a dual mapping between pages and their location on
                 disk. One mapping represents the current state of a
                 segment being modified; the other represents a previous
                 backup state. At any time the backup state can be
                 replaced by the current state without any data merging.
                 Procedures for segment modification, save, and restore
                 are analyzed. Another section proposes a facility for
                 protection against damage to the auxiliary storage
                 itself. It is shown how such protection can be obtained
                 by copying on a tape (checkpoint) only those pages that
                 have been modified since the last checkpoint.",

  abstract =     "Two kinds of abstraction that are fundamentally
                 important in database design and usage are defined.
                 Aggregation is an abstraction which turns a
                 relationship between objects into an aggregate object.
                 Generalization is an abstraction which turns a class of
                 objects into a generic object. It is suggested that all
                 objects (individual, aggregate, generic) should be
                 given uniform treatment in models of the real world. A
                 new data type, called generic, is developed as a
                 primitive for defining such models. Models defined with
                 this primitive are structured as a set of aggregation
                 hierarchies intersecting with a set of generalization
                 hierarchies. Abstract objects occur at the points of
                 intersection. This high level structure provides a
                 discipline for the organization of relational
                 databases. In particular this discipline allows: (i) an
                 important class of views to be integrated and
                 maintained; (ii) stability of data and programs under
                 certain evolutionary changes; (iii) easier
                 understanding of complex models and more natural {\em
                 query formulation;\/} (iv) {\em a more systematic
                 approach to database design;\/} (v) {\em more
                 optimization\/} to be performed at lower implementation
                 levels. The generic type is formalized by a set of
                 invariant properties. These properties should be
                 satisfied by all relations in a database if
                 abstractions are to be preserved. A triggering
                 mechanism for automatically maintaining these
                 invariants during update operations is proposed. A
                 simple mapping of aggregation/generalization
                 hierarchies onto owner-coupled set structures is
                 given.",

                 two very high level nonprocedural languages: DEFINE for
                 data description and CONVERT for data restructuring.
                 Program generation and cooperating process techniques
                 are used to achieve efficient operation.\par

                 This paper describes the design and implementation of
                 EXPRESS. DEFINE and CONVERT are summarized and the
                 implementation architecture presented.\par

                 The DEFINE description is compiled into a customized
                 PL/1 program for accessing source data. The
                 restructuring specified in CONVERT is compiled into a
                 set of customized PL/1 procedures to derive multiple
                 target files from multiple input files. Job steps and
                 job control statements are generated automatically.
                 During execution, the generated procedures run under
                 control of a process supervisor, which coordinates
                 buffer management and handles file allocation,
                 deallocation, and all input/output requests.\par

                 The architecture of EXPRESS allows efficiency in
                 execution by avoiding unnecessary secondary storage
                 references while at the same time allowing the
                 individual procedures to be independent of each other.

                 periodically in batches, even in realtime systems. The
                 purpose of this paper is to present a general model for
                 determining the optimal frequency of these batch
                 operations. Specifically, optimal backup,
                 checkpointing, batch updating, and reorganization
                 policies are derived. The approach used exploits
                 inventory parallels by seeking the optimal number of
                 items--rather than a time interval--to trigger a batch.
                 The Renewal Reward Theorem is used to find the average
                 long run costs for backup, recovery, and item storage,
                 per unit time, which is then minimized to find the
                 optimal backup policy. This approach permits far less
                 restrictive assumptions about the update arrival
                 process than did previous models, as well as inclusion
                 of storage costs for the updates. The optimal
                 checkpointing, batch updating, and reorganization
                 policies are shown to be special cases of this optimal
                 backup policy. The derivation of previous results as

                 To validate pointer implemented access paths and set
                 structures, two algorithms are developed. The first
                 procedure exploits the ``typed pointer'' concept

                 abnormalities in directories and set instances. The
                 second algorithm completes pointer validation by
                 examining set instances to ensure that each DBTG set
                 has a unique owner. Sequential processing is used by
                 both algorithms, allowing a straightforward
                 implementation which is efficient in both time and

                 arrays, cells, stacks, queues, trees, and general
                 lists. Each nonprimitive data structure consists of two
                 separate entities--a head and a body. The head contains

                 in the system consists of both explicit facts and
                 general axioms (or ``views''). The general axioms are
                 used together with the explicit facts to derive the
                 facts that are implicit (virtual relations) within the
                 system. A top-down algorithm, as used in artificial
                 intelligence work, is described to develop inferences
                 within the system. The top-down approach starts with
                 the query, a conjunction of relations, to be answered.
                 Either a relational fact solves a given relation in a
                 conjunct, or the relation is replaced by a conjunct of
                 relations which must be solved to solve the given
                 relation. The approach requires that one and only one
                 relation in a conjunction be replaced (or expanded) by
                 the given facts and general axioms. The decision to
                 expand only a single relation is termed a selection
                 function. It is shown for relational systems that such
                 a restriction still guarantees that a solution to the
                 problem will be found if one exists.\par

                 The algorithm provides for heuristic direction in the
                 search process. Experimental results are presented
                 which illustrate the techniques. A bookkeeping
                 mechanism is described which permits one to know when
