  abstract =     "A new technique for interactive vector field
                 visualization using large numbers of properly
                 illuminated stream lines is presented. Taking into
                 account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms
                 as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading
                 model which significantly increases quality and realism
                 of the resulting images. While many graphics
                 workstations offer hardware support for illuminating
                 surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate
                 shading of line primitives are provided. However, we
                 show that proper illumination of lines can be
                 implemented by exploiting the texture mapping
                 capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way
                 high rendering performance with interactive frame rates
                 can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large
                 numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The
                 impression of the resulting images can be further
                 improved by making the curves partially transparent. We
                 also describe methods for controlling the distribution
                 of stream lines in space. These methods enable us to
                 use illuminated stream lines within an interactive
                 visualization environment.",
