<h5>The '<var>Postprocessonr</var>' Page</h5>

<div align="center"><img src="profile_page_postprocessing.gif" width="416" height="365" border="0" alt=""></div>

<p>The '<var>Postprocessor</var>' page allows you to define tools, which should be run after the (La)TeX compiler, i.e. to convert the file generated by the compiler to another format.</p>

<p>The meanings of the several controls are:</p>

<dl>
   <dt>'<var>Postprocessors to run after the (La)TeX compiler</var>'</dt>
   <dd>
      The list of tools to run, after the compiler has been executed.
      <p>The tools are listed in the order of the execution.</p>
      <p>Choose the new button at the top of the list to add a new tool to the list, use the remove button (cross) to remove the selected tool from the list and move the up and down buttons to move the selected tool up or down in the execution order.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>'<var>Executable</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Specifies the full path of the currently selected tool's executable file.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Arguments</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Specifie the command line to pass to the tool. Use <a href="placeholders.html">place holders</a> for dynamic arguments.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Input redirection</var>'</dt>
   <dd>
      Specifies, where the selected tool retrieve its input from.
      <p>If nothing is specified here, the tool will retrieve its input from the standard input device (normally the keyboard), otherwise it will retrieve its input from the specified file.</p>
      <p>Use <a href="placeholders.html">place holders</a> for dynamic arguments.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>'<var>Output redirection</var>'</dt>
   <dd>
      Specifies, where the selected tool should write its output to.
      <p>If nothing is specified here, the tool will write its output to the standard output device which would normally be the console, the tool has been started from (i.e. a DOS box) or in case of TeXnicCenter the output window.</p>
      <p>Use <a href="placeholders.html">place holders</a> for dynamic arguments.</p>
   </dd>
</dl>

<p>Using input and output redirection allows you to use tools, which do not interpret command line arguments, but retrieve there input from the tool's input device and/or write there output to the tools output device.</p>

<p>An example of such a tool is "tth", which is used to convert a LaTeX document into a HTML-document. On the command line you would type</p>
<pre>
tth &lt; file.tex &gt; file.html
</pre>
<p>When using this tool with TeXnicCenter, you have to use "file.tex" as input and "file.html" as output redirection. The command line of this tool has to be empty.</p>
