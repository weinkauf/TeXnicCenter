<h2>Project Management</h2>

<p>TeXnicCenter provides a project management, that helps you to keep files of one document together and to generate output for a document - especially, when working on large documents.</p>

<p>For each project, a project file will be generated that keeps the project's properties. Those informations are:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The path of the project's main file (the file that will be passed to the LaTeX compiler), relative to the directory, the project file is placed in.</li>
   <li>A flag that specifies, if the current project uses BibTeX.</li>
   <li>A flag that specified, if the current project uses MakeIndex.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some features like the structure view (navigator bar on the left side of TeXnicCenter's main window), and the automatic start of BibTeX and MakeIndex are only available, when a project is open.</p>

<p>Using projects is very simple. Just <a href="project_create.html">create a new project</a>, when starting the work on a new document. If the requirements for the porject have changed, you can simply <a href="project_modify.html">modify the project's properties</a>.</p>
