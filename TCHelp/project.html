<p>TeXnicCenter provides a project management tool, that helps to keep the
files of one document together and to generate output for a document -
especially, when working on large documents.</p>

<p>For each project, a project file will be generated, that stores the
project's properties. Those informations are:</p>

<p>
<ul>
   <li>The path to the main file of the project (This file will be passed to
   the LaTeX compiler), relative to the directory, the project file is
   placed in.</li>
   <li>A flag that specifies, if the current project uses BibTeX.</li>
   <li>A flag that specified, if the current project uses MakeIndex.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Some features like Structure View (i.e. the navigator bar on the left
side of the main window), and the automatic start of BibTeX and MakeIndex
are only available, if a project is opened.</p>

<p>Using projects is very simple. Just
<a href="project_create.html">create a new project</a>, before starting
to work on a new document. If the requirements for the project have changed,
you can simply
<a href="project_modify.html">modify the project's properties</a>.</p>
