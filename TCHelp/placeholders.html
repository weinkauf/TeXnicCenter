<h2>Placeholders</h2>

<p>A very powerfull feature of TeXnicCenter are the placeholders, which are used in several cases to specify things that can change dynamically during runtime. This allows the user to configure TeXnicCenter very flexible, because command line arguments, DDE-commands or other things like that do not have to be specified statically, but will be generated by TeXnicCenter dynamically when needed.</p>

<p>Placeholders are a kind of variable. The user just specifies the name of the variable and TeXnicCenter sets the variables value dynamically and replaces its name with the current value, when needed.</p>

<p>There a two types of placeholders in TeXnicCenter:</p>

<dl>
   <dt><a href="placeholdersingle.html">Placeholders for single files</a></dt>
   <dd>They are often used to define command line arguments and DDE-commands.</dd>

   <dt><a href="placeholdersets.html">Placeholders for sets of files</a></dt>
   <dd>They are used to deal with more than one file at a time.</dd>
</dl>
