Environments are expanded automatically with appropriate <B>\begin</B> and <B>\end</B> commands. For example:
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/auto_expand1.gif" width="250" height="140" border="0" alt=""></div>
</p>
Pressing CTRL + SPACE changes "tabu" to 
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/auto_expand2.gif" width=250" height="140" border="0" alt=""></div>

A lot of users have their own document classes and/or style files which nice commands ease up their daily work. You may TeXnicCenter make searching these packages and create a XML file containing your commands and environments.</p>

To scan a directory for style file and document classes, use the "Search packages" command given under "Extras: Search for packages".

In the first dialog you will be asked for a directory which contains your personal files. The search considers also including subdirectories, so scanning c:\texmf will find all packages and classes of your LaTeX distribution.

During scan a dialog box informs you about scanned files and directories.

After search has finished, a second dialog asks you for a directory to save the composed XML file named 'packages,xml'.

<p>The contents of this file may be merged with the contents of the provided 'packages.xml' file which is located in the directory where TeXnicCenter is installed in.
