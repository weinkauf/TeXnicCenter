<h3>Options - Page '<var>Clean</var>'</h3>

<p>The page '<var>Clean</var>' of the <a href="options.html">'<var>Options</var>' dialog</a> allows you to modify which files will be deleted and protected by TeXnicCenter when you use the <var>Clean Project</var> command from the <var>Build</var> menu.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Use caution when configuring this command as deleting the wrong files may cause a lost of important data. While TeXnicCenter tries its best to prevent you from deleting your work, it can not take on the responsibility for that.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="options_clean.gif" width="379" height="348" border="0" alt=""></div>

<p>The meaning of the controls are:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>'<var>Edit entries</var>'</dt>
   <dd>The entries in the list box below define the files to be deleted
   or protected. Scroll through this list and click on an entry to edit
   or remove it.</dd>

   <dd>There are two entries at the end of the list,
   which can not be edited or removed. These two entries are used to
   protect all files of the project and all files, which are opened in
   the editor. Which files TeXnicCenter recognizes to be part of
   the project can be seen in the <var>FileView</var> tab of the
   <var>Navigation</var> window. It can not be assured, that this set
   includes every file of your work.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Add</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Pressing this button adds a new entry to the list.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Remove</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Pressing this button removes the selected entry from the list.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Sort</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Pressing this button sorts the list of entries to get a better overview.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Description</var>'</dt>
   <dd>This edit box is used to change the description text of the
   selected entry. This text has no meaning to TeXnicCenter - you can
   type here whatever helps you to remind the selected entry.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Pattern</var>'</dt>
   <dd>The text in this control defines a file or a set of files to act on
   for the selected entry</dd>

   <dd>It is allowed to use Wildcards (<b>*</b> and <b>?</b>) as known
   from the Windows command line. Additionally, it is allowed to use
   <a href="placeholders.html">placeholders for single files</a> and
   <a href="placeholdersets.html">placeholders for sets of files</a> here.
   The combination of wildcards together with
   <a href="placeholders.html">placeholders for single files</a> is supported.
   However, any other combination is not allowed.
   Use the button to the right of this edit box to insert a placeholder
   or type it manually.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Action</var>'</dt>
   <dd>This control selects the action to be performed on the file(s)
   defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b> for the selected entry.
   The following actions are available:
   <ul>
       <li><b>delete</b> - The files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>
       will only be deleted, if they are not protected by another entry
       in the list.</li>

       <li><b>protect</b> - The files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>
       will be protected from deletion. If an entry
       defines a file to be protected and another entry defines
       the same file to be deleted, the file will be protected.</li>

       <li><b>none</b> - The selected entry will not be used to build
       up the lists for deletion or protection. Use this action, if you
       do not want to delete an entry, but want to deactivate it.</li>
   </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt>'<var>Include subdirectories</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If selected, TeXnicCenter searches the subdirectories of the
   active project for
   matching files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>, too.
   This refers to the selected entry.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Confirm before delete</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If selected, TeXnicCenter will show a dialog before deleting
   files. This dialog lists all the files to be deleted and protected.
   It is possible to cancel the action using this dialog.
   </dd>
