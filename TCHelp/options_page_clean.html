<p>The tab '<var>Clean</var>' in the dialog
<a href="options.html">'<var>Options</var>'</a> allows to modify file
protection and file deletion when using the command <var>Clean Project</var>
in the menu <var>Build</var>.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b><br>
Please be carefull when configuring this command. Deleting the wrong files
may cause loss of important data. While TeXnicCenter tries its best to
prevent deletion of work, it can not take any responsibility for that.</p>

</p>

<p>The meaning of the controls are:</p>
<p>
<dl>
   <dt>'<var>Edit entries</var>'</dt>
   <dd>The entries in the list box below define the files to be deleted
   or protected. Scroll through this list and click on an entry to edit
   or remove it.</dd>

   <dd>There are two entries at the end of the list,
   which can not be edited or removed. These two entries are used to
   protect all files of the project and all files, which are currently
   opened in the editor. Files recognized by TeXnicCenter as a part of
   the project are shown on the tab <var>FileView</var> in the window
   <var>Navigation</var>. This set may not include all files of the
   current project.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Add</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Pressing this button adds a new entry to the list.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Remove</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Pressing this button removes the selected entry from the list.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Sort</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Pressing this button sorts the list of entries for a better
   overview.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Description</var>'</dt>
   <dd>This edit box is used to change the description text of the
   selected entry. This text does not mean anything to TeXnicCenter -
   type here whatever helps to remind/explain the selected entry.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Pattern</var>'</dt>
   <dd>The text in this control defines a file or a set of files to act on
   for the selected entry.</dd>

   <dd>It is allowed to use the same wildcards (<b>*</b> and <b>?</b>) as known
   from a Windows command line. Additionally, use
   <a href="placeholdersingle.html">placeholders for single files</a> and
   <a href="placeholdersets.html">placeholders for sets of files</a> here.
   The combination of wildcards with placeholders for single files is
   supported, any other combination <b>not</b>.<br>
   Use the button on the right of the edit box to insert a
   <a href="placeholders.html">placeholder</a> or type it in manually.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Action</var>'</dt>
   <dd>This control selects the action to be performed on the file(s)
   defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b> for the selected entry.
   The following actions are available:
   <ul>
       <li><b>delete</b> - The files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>
       will only be deleted, if they are not protected by another entry
       in the list.</li>

       <li><b>protect</b> - The files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>
       will be protected from deletion. If an entry defines a file to be
       protected and another entry defines the same file to be deleted,
       the file will be protected, i.d. the deletion entry will be ignored.</li>

       <li><b>none</b> - The selected entry will not be used to build
       up the lists for deletion or protection. Use this action, if an
       entry should be deactivate.</li>
   </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt>'<var>Include subdirectories</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If selected, TeXnicCenter searches the subdirectories of the
   active project for matching files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>,
   too. This refers to the selected entry.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Confirm before delete</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If selected, TeXnicCenter will show a dialog before deleting files.
   This dialog lists all the files to be deleted and protected.<br>
   Clicking on the button Cancel will terminate the action.</dd>
