<p>The tab '<var>Clean</var>' in the dialog
<a href="options.html">'<var>Options</var>'</a> allows users to modify
file
protection and file deletion options when using the command <var>Clean
Project</var>
in the menu <var>Build</var>.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b><br>
Please be carefull when configuring this command. Deleting the wrong
files
may cause loss of important data. While TeXnicCenter tries its best to
prevent deletion of essential files, you are responsible for this, too.</p>

<p>The meaning of the controls is:</p>
<p>
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>'<var>File groups</var>'</dt>
  <dd>The entries in the list box below define the files to be deleted
or protected. Scroll through this list and select an entry to edit or
remove it.</dd>
  <dd>There are two entries at the end of the list, which can not be
edited or removed. These two entries are used to protect all files of
the project and all files that are currently opened within the editor.
Files recognized by TeXnicCenter as a part of the project are shown on
the tab <var>Files</var> in the <var>Navigation</var> window. The
listed
set may not include all files of the current project.&nbsp; You may add
any not already recognized by TeXnicCenter.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>New</var>'</dt>
  <dd>Pressing this button adds a new entry to the list.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>Remove</var>'</dt>
  <dd>Pressing this button removes the selected entry from the list.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>Sort</var>'</dt>
  <dd>Pressing this button sorts the list of entries for a better
overview.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>Description</var>'</dt>
  <dd>This edit box is used to change the description text of the
selected entry. This text does not mean anything to TeXnicCenter --
type
here whatever would be helpful in understanding the selected entry.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>Pattern</var>'</dt>
  <dd>The text in this control defines a file or a set of files to act
on for the selected entry.</dd>
  <dd>It is permissible to use the same wildcards (<b>*</b> and <b>?</b>)
permitted in a Windows command line. Additionally, you may use <a
 href="placeholdersingle.html">placeholders for single files</a> and <a
 href="placeholdersets.html">placeholders for sets of files</a> here.
The combination of wildcards with placeholders for single files is
supported, but no other combination is permitted.<br>
Use the button on the right of the edit box to select a <a
 href="placeholders.html">placeholder</a> from a list.&nbsp;
Alternatively, you may type it in manually.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>Action</var>'</dt>
  <dd>This control selects the action to be performed on the file(s)
defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b> for the selected entry. The
following actions are available:
    <ul>
      <li><b>none</b> - The selected entry will not be used to build up
the lists for deletion or protection. Use this action to deactivate an
entry without removing it altogether.</li>
      <li><b>delete</b> - The files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>
will be deleted unless they are protected by another entry in the
list.</li>
      <li><b>protect</b> - The files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>
will be protected from deletion. If an entry defines a file to be
protected and another entry defines the same file to be deleted, the
file will be protected, i.e., the deletion entry will be ignored.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>'<var>Include subdirectories</var>'</dt>
  <dd>If selected, TeXnicCenter searches the subdirectories of the
active project for matching files defined by <b>'<var>Pattern</var>'</b>,
too. The choice can differ for different file groups.</dd>
  <dt>'<var>Confirm before delete</var>'</dt>
  <dd>If selected, TeXnicCenter will show a dialog before deleting
files. This dialog lists all the files to be deleted and protected. <br>
    <br>
This entry refers to all entries in the table,
not just the one
currently selected.<br>
  </dd>
