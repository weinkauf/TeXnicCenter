<p>TeXnicCenter is an integrated development environment (IDE) for
developing
LaTeX documents on Microsoft Windows (Windows 9x/ME, NT/2000/XP).</p>
<p>The term IDE means that TeXnicCenter includes many of the
tools needed to develop documents with LaTeX in just one application.
Use the
text editor to write LaTeX files.&nbsp; You can then start the build
process to convert your LaTeX source document into a typeset output by
just choosing a menu
item or pushing a button on the toolbar. The output of the LaTeX
compiler is written to a window and analyzed.&nbsp; It is easy to show
errors, warnings, or bad boxes by clicking on
a toolbar icon.&nbsp; Repeating this action will take you to successive
errors and son on, if there are any.<br>
</p>
<p>Viewing the generated output is easy with TeXnicCenter. Just choose
a
menu item and the appropriate viewer application will be started.&nbsp;
For viewers that support this, the output displayed will correspond to
that located at the current position
of the cursor in the source file.</p>
<p>TeXnicCenter's aim is to support new users of LaTeX by providing the
most
important LaTeX constructs via menu entries and by abstracting the use
of the
LaTeX compiler and other tools like MakeIndex and BibTeX.&nbsp;
However, TeXnicCenter also supports experiences users of LaTeX by
providing a powerfull, fully customizable and integrated
environment.</p>
