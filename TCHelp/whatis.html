<p>TeXnicCenter is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing
LaTeX-documents on Microsoft Windows (Windows 9x/ME, NT/2000/XP).</p>

<p>IDE means, that TeXnicCenter is an application, that integrates all the
tools, needed to develop documents with LaTeX, in just one application. Use the
editor to write LaTeX files, start the building process by just choosing a menu
item. The output of the LaTeX compiler is written to a window and analyzed,
simply jump from one error, warning or bad box to another one, by clicking on
an entry.</p>

<p>Viewing the generated output is easy with TeXnicCenter. Just choose a
menu item and the appropriate viewer application will be started and if
supported by the viewer, the output will be displayed at the current position
of the cursor in the current source file.</p>

<p>TeXnicCenter's aim is to support the LaTeX-newbie by providing the most
important LaTeX constructs via menu entries and by abstracting the use of the
LaTeX compiler and other tools like MakeIndex and BibTeX and even support
the LaTeX-pro by providing a powerfull, fully customizable and integrated
environment.</p>
