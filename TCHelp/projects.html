<p>TeXnicCenter manages your documents always as projects. Even if there is
only one file (i.e. a letter), you have to create a project for this document.
It is wise to create a directory for each project. Please refer to the
section <a href="creating_projects.html">Creating Project</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>A project contains the following informations:</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Path of the project directory</li>
  <li>Path of the project's main file</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>Always put the files of one project in the project's directory. One of
these files has to be the project's main file. The main file is the file, that
is passed to the LaTeX compiler. If a document is split into several
LaTeX files, they should be included into the project's main file with the
commands <code>\input</code> or <code>\include</code>.</p>

<p>TeXnicCenter needs to know the main file of a project. Specify the main
file, when creating the project, or change it later, by choosing the menu item
'<var>Properties...</var>' from the menu'<var>Project</var>' and
changing the path '<var>Main file</var>'.</p>
