<h3>Customizing the Look & Feel</h3>

<p>TeXnicCenter allows you to widely customize the look and feel of the graphical user interface including downloadable skins.</p>

<p>To customize the look & feel, you have to <a href="customization.html">open the customization dialog</a> and select the '<var>Options</var>' page.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="custom_page_options.gif" width="306" height="236" border="0" alt=""></div>

<p>The controls of the page are having the following meanings:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>'<var>Show ScreenTips on toolbars</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If this option is enabled, a small yellow window (ScreenTips) with a short description will appear, when you move the mouse cursor above a toolbar icon and wait for a moment.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Show shortcut keys in ScreenTips</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If this option is enabled, the ScreenTips will contain the shortcut for the specific command besides the short description of the command.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Large Icon</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If this option is enabled all toolbar icons will be displayed in double size.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Look 2000</var>'</dt>
   <dd>If this option is enabled, controls of the user interface will be displayed in a more modern (more flat) look. Simply try it.</dd>

   <dt>'<var>Visualization...</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Press this Button to change the general look & feel of the user interface.
   <p>The vizalization includes the look & feel of the toolbars, the menu bars, etc. It is what you may know under the term "skin".</p>
   <p>Several viszalizations are already shipped with TeXnicCenter. The visualization dialog also provides you the possibility to download new schemes from the internet.</p>
