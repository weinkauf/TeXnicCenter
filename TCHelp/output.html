<p>The LaTeX files are just simple text files. To get a printable
output,
they have to be compiled. Current TeX distributions support several
formats like the TeX-specific DVI-format, PostScript or the very widely
used PDF-format.</p>
<p>Where other editors can only produce one format as output,
TeXnicCenter allows the user to select any of these output
formats.&nbsp; It&nbsp;
can even be extended to include other formats available in other TeX
distributions or through the use of additional filters.</p>
<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">

</p>
<p>For each output format used, an output profile has to be defined
first. The
number of output profiles in TeXnicCenter is not fixed:&nbsp; you can
add more as you see the need to do so.</p>
<p>Output profiles specify answers to a number of questions:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is a (La)TeX compiler necessary to generate the output?<br>
If so, what is the path to it?<br>
What are the command line arguments to pass to the compiler?</li>
  <li>Is a BibTeX compiler available for the specified format?<br>
If it is, what is the path to it?<br>
What are the command line arguments to pass to the compiler?</li>
  <li>Is a MakeIndex compiler available for the specified format?<br>
If so, what is the path to it?<br>
What are the command line arguments to pass to the compiler.</li>
  <li>Which additional tools (postprocessors) have to be started after
or instead of the TeX compiler to generate the desired output?</li>
  <li>Which application is used to view files in the desired format?<br>
What are the commands needed to display an output file?<br>
What are the commands needed to perform a forward search?<br>
Is it necessary to close the output before the compilation starts? If
it is, what is the command to do so?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
