<h3>Customizing Commands</h3>

<p>To customize the commands, which are available on the several toolbars and in the menus, you have to <a href="customization.html">open the customization dialog</a> and select the '<var>Commands</var>' page.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="custom_page_commands.gif" width="306" height="236" border="0" alt=""></div>

<p>When this page is active, you can simply drag & drop commands from one menu to another one, from one toolbar to another one, from a toolbar to a menu and vice versa. Further on, you can drag & drop commands, not already available on the toolbars or the menus from the '<var>Commands</var>' list of the dialog page.</p>

<p>You can also change the text and/or the image of menu items and toolbar buttons. Simply select a menu item or a button, right click on it and choose '<var>Button Appearance...</var>'.</p>

<p>The controls of the page are having the following meaning:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>'<var>Categories</var>'</dt>
   <dd>Choose the category of commands, to display in the '<var>Commands</var>' list.</dd>
