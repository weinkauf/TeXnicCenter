<h3>Configuration of the Output Profiles</h3>

<p>To configure the output profiles, there are two ways:</p>

<ul>
   <li>The first and the simplest one (especially if you are using MikTeX), is to use the <a href="output_config_wizard.html">Ouput Wizard</a>. This wizard will also be started automatically, if you are starting TeXnicCenter for the first time.</li>

   <li>The second way is to configure the ouput profiles <a href="output_config_manually.html">manually</a>. This is more work intensive, but provides you also more flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally you can configure the output profiles, generated by the output wizard, later manually, using the output configuration.</p>

<p>If you are using the MikTeX-distribution, you should always use the output wizard. He will recognize, that MikTeX is installed on your system and will generate output profiles for DVI, PDF and postscript.</p>
