<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>For each output format you would like to use, there has to exist an output profile. There can unlimited output profiles defined in TeXnicCenter.</p>

<p>An output profile describes the following properties:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Is the (La)TeX compiler necessary to generate the wanted output and if it is, what is the path of the (La)TeX compiler and what are the command line arguments to pass to the compiler.</li>
   <li>Is a BibTeX compiler available for the specified format and if it is, what is the path of the compiler and what are the command line arguments to pass to the compiler.</li>
   <li>Is a MakeIndex compiler available for the specified format and if it is, what is the path of the compiler and what are the command line arguments to pass to the compiler.</li>
   <li>Which additional tools (postprocessors) have to be started after or instead of the (La)TeX compiler to generate the wanted output.</li>
   <li>Which application is used to view files of the wanted format, what are the commands to display an output file, to perform a forward search and is it necessary to close the output before the compilation in TeXnicCenter starts and if it is, what is the command to do that.</li>
</ul>
