<p>The Output Wizard leads through the configuration of some basic output
profiles step by step. If the MiKTeX distribution is installed, the Output
Wizard canl do nearly all the work without user interaction.</p>

<p>
<table border="0" width="100%">

<td class="h5">Invoking the Output Wizard</td>

</p>

<p>After TeXnicCenter has started, it checks to see whether output profiles are
already defined. If this is not the case, TeXnicCenter will then start the
Output Wizard automatically.</p>

<p>To start the Output Wizard manually, please select the menu item
'<var>Build|Define Output Profiles...</var>' and click on the button
'<var>Wizard</var>' in the next dialog.</p>

</p>

<p>At first the Wizard will look for an installed  MikTeX distribution. If
MikTeX is found on the system, the Wizard asks for permission to configure
TeXnicCenter accordingly or to use another distribution.</p>

<p>To configure TeXnicCenter to use MikTeX, the Wizard will perform the
following steps:</p>
<p>
<ol>
   <li>It will look for the TeX compiler. If no compiler can be found, the
   path to the compiler can be entered in a dialog.</li>
   <li>Afterwards the Wizard will look for the registered DVI-viewer. If
   the registered viewer is YAP, TeXnicCenter will be configured to YAP as
   default viewer. If another viewer is found, command line parameters to
   start the viewer, to view documents and to perform a forward search, can be
   entered in a dialog.</li>
   <li>Now the wizard will test if DVIPS (a tool that convert DVI documents
   into PostScript files) is installed. If DVIPS is found, the path for
   command line arguments can be entered in a dialog.</li>
   <li>Finally the Wizard will test if pdfLaTeX is installed. If this test
   is successfull, the Wizard will look for the viewer registered for
   PDF files. If the viewer is the Adobe AcrobatReader, the wizard will do
   the configuration, otherwise the path and the command line arguments
   for a different PDF viewer can be entered in a dialog.</li>
   <li>Now TeXnicCenter will create the following output profiles:
      <ul>
         <li>LaTeX =&gt; DVI (only if LaTeX has been found);</li>
         <li>LaTeX =&gt; PS (only if DVIPS and LaTeX have been found);</li>
         <li>LaTeX =&gt; PDF (only if pdfLaTeX has been found).</li>
      </ul>
      If one of the above mentioned output profiles already exists, the Wizard
      will ask permission to overwrite or to keep the existing one.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>To check, what the Wizard has created, open the dialog
<a href="output_config_manually.html">Manual Configuration</a>.</p>
