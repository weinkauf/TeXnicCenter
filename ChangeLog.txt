- UserTools have been enhanced:
  - Dialog supports new placeholder menus.

    version of TXC can not read them anymore after this.
    ==> BACKUP your registry, to be on the safe side. <==

2002/07/01 svenwiegand
- Fixed Bug: Single quotes (') after a word were interpreted as a character 
  of the word from CLatexParser::NextWord(). This made the spell checker 
  mark this as a spelling error.
- Feature 540886: Remove error marker when editing a line. Fixed it in another
  way: All error marks will be removed, when a new compilation is about to
  be started.
- Using CFileDialogEx from MFCExt-library now instead of default CFileDialog 
  class. Both are totally compatible, but CFileDialogEx will create Win2000 
  styled dialogs on Win2000 or later (commonly used folder bar at the left).
