- Implemented basic spell checker functionality. The spell checker is based
on the MySpell library, which is the same implementation used by Mozilla and
OpenOffice. Dictionaries for several languages (~10) are available for 
download on the Internet from the OpenOffice webpage. Dictionaries moved into 
to the \language subdirectory of the directory TeXnicCenter are installed 
and ready for use. More work is scheduled for the spell checker in the 
future. Future features include: check as you type and personal dictionary.

- At the start of the ProfileDialog (for defining of profiles),
  the active profile is now selected.
  This is similar to the ActiveProfileDialog.
- CMainFrame::GetToolbarButton scans now the UserToolbars as well.
  This way the ComboBoxes to change the active profile (ID_LATEX_PROFILE_SEL)
  will be updated in UserToolbars as well.
- In german IDD_PROFILE_LATEX the static IDC_TITLE_MAKEINDEXARGUMENTS
  was changed from "Argumente, die an BibTeX..." to "... MakeIndex ...".
- Added Profile-Option for "Stop Compilation, if LaTeX-Error occures".
  If checked and TeX reports "No pages of output" and error code != 0,
  TXC will NOT run bibTeX, makeIndex and postprocessors (behaviour as before).
  If unchecked (default) and TeX reports at least one page of output,
  TXC will run postprocessors - independently of the error code by TeX.
- Parsing the LaTeX-Output for the number of pages created by LaTeX and
  reporting this to the user via STE_LATEX_RESULT.

- A double click on a template in the template dialogs ('document from template'
  and 'new project') is now equivalent to pressing the 'OK' button.
- Put a yellow frame around the 16x16 TXC icon.
