- Fixed Bug 616808: Figures not centered correctly
- Fixed similar Bugs 607758 & 634320: Tools not working & Windows Explorer tool
- Fixed Bug 609909: TeXnicCenter may overwrite a .tex file
  This includes, that project files from versions till Beta3.00.000
  can not be opened anymore. If some users still have such files, they
  need to use Beta6.01 to convert the project-files. It is very unlikely,
  that such old things still exist.
- Fixed Bug 643907: List of Options|Clean not always updated
- UserTools have been enhanced:
  - Dialog supports new placeholder menus.
  - Started implementation of new features like in/out-redirection.
  - NOTE: This makes it incompatible to the old tools. The old ones
    have not been implemented using IMPLEMENT_SERIAL(). But the new ones
    need this. The new version is able to import the old tools, but an old
    version of TXC can not read them anymore after this.
    ==> BACKUP your registry, to be on the safe side. <==
- Removed old Placeholder menus. They are no longer needed.
- Introduced new global AfxGetDefaultDirectory()-function. Serves as
  simplification of Feature 539142: "Configurable Default Path for Documents"
  and for executing tools.

  Tools is still waiting to be simplified.

2002/07/01 svenwiegand
- Fixed Bug: Single quotes (') after a word were interpreted as a character 
  of the word from CLatexParser::NextWord(). This made the spell checker 
  mark this as a spelling error.
- Feature 540886: Remove error marker when editing a line. Fixed it in another
  way: All error marks will be removed, when a new compilation is about to
  be started.
- Using CFileDialogEx from MFCExt-library now instead of default CFileDialog 
  class. Both are totally compatible, but CFileDialogEx will create Win2000 
  styled dialogs on Win2000 or later (commonly used folder bar at the left).

2002/06/28 svenwiegand

  add an item, if it is already in the list. Has some advandced features as well.
- Added internal support for Placeholder sets (set of filesnames
  defined by a placeholder). Have a look at placeholder.h to read, what it does.

- Implemented basic spell checker functionality. The spell checker is based
on the MySpell library, which is the same implementation used by Mozilla and
OpenOffice. Dictionaries for several languages (~10) are available for 
download on the Internet from the OpenOffice webpage. Dictionaries moved into 
to the \language subdirectory of the directory TeXnicCenter are installed 
and ready for use. More work is scheduled for the spell checker in the 
future. Future features include: check as you type and personal dictionary.

2002/04/02 niteria
- Translated the new strings for parsing (introduced by Chris) to german.
- Fix for Bug 538164 in CCrystalTextView::ResetView().

2002/04/01 niteria
- At the start of the ProfileDialog (for defining of profiles),
  the active profile is now selected.
  This is similar to the ActiveProfileDialog.
- CMainFrame::GetToolbarButton scans now the UserToolbars as well.
  This way the ComboBoxes to change the active profile (ID_LATEX_PROFILE_SEL)
  will be updated in UserToolbars as well.
- In german IDD_PROFILE_LATEX the static IDC_TITLE_MAKEINDEXARGUMENTS
  was changed from "Argumente, die an BibTeX..." to "... MakeIndex ...".
- Added Profile-Option for "Stop Compilation, if LaTeX-Error occures".
  If checked and TeX reports "No pages of output" and error code != 0,
  TXC will NOT run bibTeX, makeIndex and postprocessors (behaviour as before).
  If unchecked (default) and TeX reports at least one page of output,
  TXC will run postprocessors - independently of the error code by TeX.
- Parsing the LaTeX-Output for the number of pages created by LaTeX and
  reporting this to the user via STE_LATEX_RESULT.

2002/03/19 svenwiegand
