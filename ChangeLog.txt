- At the start of the ProfileDialog (for defining of profiles),
  the active profile is now selected.
  This is similar to the ActiveProfileDialog.
- CMainFrame::GetToolbarButton scans now the UserToolbars as well.
  This way the ComboBoxes to change the active profile (ID_LATEX_PROFILE_SEL)
  will be updated in UserToolbars as well.
- In german IDD_PROFILE_LATEX the static IDC_TITLE_MAKEINDEXARGUMENTS
  was changed from "Argumente, die an BibTeX..." to "... MakeIndex ...".
- Added Profile-Option for "Stop Compilation, if LaTeX-Error occures".
  If checked and TeX reports "No pages of output" and error code != 0,
  TXC will NOT run bibTeX, makeIndex and postprocessors (behaviour as before).
  If unchecked (default) and TeX reports at least one page of output,
  TXC will run postprocessors - independently of the error code by TeX.
- Parsing the LaTeX-Output for the number of pages created by LaTeX and
  reporting this to the user via STE_LATEX_RESULT.

- A double click on a template in the template dialogs ('document from template'
  and 'new project') is now equivalent to pressing the 'OK' button.
- Put a yellow frame around the 16x16 TXC icon.
