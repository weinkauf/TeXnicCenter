1. Build regexpp-lib:
   a) Open a command line
   b) Ensure that the environment variables, required to use the command line
      tools of Visual C++ 6 are setup properly. If you are not sure if this is
      the case, then execute the 'VCVARS32.BAT' file from the command line, 
      which should be located in the directory 'VC98\BIN' in your Visual C++
      program directory (i.e. 'C:\Program Files\Visual C++').
   c) Change into the 'regexpp\lib\directory'
   d) Execute the 'VC6.BAT' file to build the library

2. Copy the files

    mre200dl.dll
