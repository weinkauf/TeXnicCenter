BUILDING TEXNICCENTER

Note: The build process has been automated. I have tested it and seems to work 
      properly. If any problems occur, please let me know and refer to the steps 
      of the old process which are given at the end of this document.

1. Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop:
   a) Download it from Microsoft ('http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/')
   b) Install it on your system (including the necessary header files)
   c) Add the directory that includes the header files
      to the list of include directories in the Visual C++ 6 options
      ('Tools -> Options -> Directories -> Include files').
   d) Add the library path as well
      ('Tools -> Options -> Directories -> Library files').
   e) Finally add the path to hhc.exe as well
   	  ('Tools -> Options -> Directories -> Executable files').

2. Install Microsoft XML Parser:
   a) Download the most recent version of the Microsoft XML Parser 4 (MSXML4) 
      including the SDK from 'http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/'
   b) Install it on your system.
   c) Add the include and library paths of MSXML to the list in Visual C++ 6
      ('Tools -> Options ->Directories').

3. Download the BCGControlBarLibrary header- and lib-files ("GUI Lib") from 

     http://www.texniccenter.org/resources/developer-resources

   and unpack the ZIP-archive to the directory, this file (HowToBuild.txt) is
   placed in.

4. Open the TeXnicCenter-workspace ('TeXnicCenter\TeXnicCenter.dsw') in Visual 
   C++.

5. Build the debug and release versions of TeXnicCenter. ("Batch build")

Building is now completed. You can start TeXnicCenter.

--------------------------------- Old procedure --------------------------------
You will only need the following procedure, if the new one does not work for 
you.

1. Build regexpp-lib:
   a) Open a command line
   b) Ensure that the environment variables, required to use the command line
      tools of Visual C++ 6 are setup properly. If you are not sure if this is
      the case, then execute the 'VCVARS32.BAT' file from the command line, 
      which should be located in the directory 'VC98\BIN' in your Visual C++
      program directory (i.e. 'C:\Program Files\Visual C++').
   c) Change into the 'regexpp\lib directory'
   d) Execute the 'VC6.BAT' file to build the library

2. Copy the files

    mre200dl.dll
    mre200dl.ilk
    mre200dl.pdb

   from the 'regexpp\lib' directory to the 'output\Debug' directory.

3. Copy the file

    mre200l.dll

   from the 'regexpp\lib' directory to the 'output\Release' directory.

9. Build the TeXnicCenter-Help-File using HTML Help Workshop with the 
    'TCHelp\TeXnicCenter.hhp' project.

10. Copy all files matching

     '*.chm'  or  '*.chw'

    from the 'output' directory to the 'output\debug\help' and 
    'output\release\help' directory.

     GPL_english.htm
     GPL_german.htm
     Tips_english.txt
     Tips_german.txt
     UserImages.bmp

    from the 'TeXnicCenter' directory to

     a) the 'output\debug' directory
     b) the 'output\release' directory

12. Copy all files matching '*.xsd' from the 'TeXnicCenter\xmlschema' directory
    to 'output\debug' and 'output\release'.

12. Create a directory called 'language' in 'output\debug' and 'output\release'.

13. Copy the files

     *.aff
     *.dic

    from the 'MySpell' directory to

     a) the 'output\debug\language' directory
