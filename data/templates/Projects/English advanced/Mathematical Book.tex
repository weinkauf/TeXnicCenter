\chapter*{Preface}

\markboth{PREFACE}{PREFACE} This is the preface and it is created
using a TeX field in a paragraph by itself containing
\verb|\chapter*{Preface}|. When the document is loaded, this
appears if it were a normal chapter, but it is actually an
unnumbered chapter.

\mainmatter

\part{The First Part}

\chapter{About the AMS Book or Monograph Class}

This is the body (mainmatter) of the AMS Book or Monograph sample
document.

The front matter has a number of sample entries that you should
replace with your own.

Replace this text with the body of your book. Do not delete the
\verb|mainmatter| TeX field found above in a paragraph by itself
or the numbering of different objects will be wrong.

The typesetting specification selected by this document uses the
default class options. There are, however, a number of class
options. The available options include setting the paper size and
the point size of the font used in the body of the document etc.
Details are given as comments right after the \verb|documentclass|
command.

\chapter{Features of this Sample Document}

\section{Section}

Use the \verb"\section{Section}" command for major sections, and
the \verb"\subsection{Subsection}" command for subsections, etc.

\subsection{Subsection}

This is just some text under a subsection.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

This is just some text under a subsubsection.

\paragraph{Subsubsubsection}

This is just some  text under a subsubsubsection.

\subparagraph{Subsubsubsubsection}

This is just some text under a subsubsubsubsection.

\section{Typesetting Commands}

Select a part of the text then click on the button Emphasize (H!),
or Bold (Fs), or Italic (Kt), or Slanted (Kt) to typeset
\emph{Emphasize}, \textbf{Bold}, \textit{Italics},
\textsl{Slanted} texts.

You can also typeset \textrm{Roman}, \textsf{Sans Serif},
\textsc{Small Caps}, and \texttt{Typewriter} texts.

You can also apply the special, mathematics only commands
$\mathbb{BLACKBOARD}$ $\mathbb{BOLD}$, $\mathcal{CALLIGRAPHIC}$,
and $\mathfrak{fraktur}$. Note that blackboard bold and
calligraphic are correct only when applied to uppercase letters A
through Z.

You can apply the size tags -- Format menu, Font size submenu --
{\tiny tiny}, {\scriptsize scriptsize}, {\footnotesize
footnotesize}, {\small small}, {\normalsize normalsize}, {\large
large}, {\Large Large}, {\LARGE LARGE}, {\huge huge} and {\Huge
Huge}.

You can use the \verb"\begin{quote} etc. \end{quote}" environment
for typesetting short quotations. Select the text then click on
Insert, Quotations, Short Quotations:

\begin{quote}
The buck stops here. \emph{Harry Truman}

Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for
your country. \emph{John F Kennedy}

I am not a crook. \emph{Richard Nixon}

I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
\emph{Bill Clinton}
\end{quote}

The Quotation environment is used for quotations of more than one
paragraph. Following is the beginning of \emph{The Jungle Books}
by Rudyard Kipling. (You should select the text first then click
on Insert, Quotations, Quotation):

\begin{quotation}
It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee Hills
when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself,
yawned  and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of
sleepy feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray
nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the
moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived.
``\emph{Augrh}'' said Father Wolf, ``it is time to hunt again.''
And he was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a
bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: ``Good luck go with
you, O Chief of the Wolves; and good luck and strong white teeth
go with the noble children, that they may never forget the hungry
in this world.''

It was the jackal---Tabaqui the Dish-licker---and the wolves of
India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and
telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the
village rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because
Tabaqui, more than any one else in the jungle, is apt to go mad,
and then he forgets that he was afraid of anyone, and runs through
the forest biting everything in his way.
\end{quotation}

Use the Verbatim environment if you want \LaTeX\ to preserve
spacing, perhaps when including a fragment from a program such as:
\begin{verbatim}
#include <iostream>         // < > is used for standard libraries.
void main(void)             // ''main'' method always called first.
{
 cout << ''This is a message.'';
                            // Send to output stream.
}
\end{verbatim}
(After selecting the text click on Insert, Code Environments,
Code.)


\section{Mathematics and Text}

It holds \cite{KarelRektorys} the following
\begin{theorem}
(The Currant minimax principle.) Let $T$ be completely continuous
selfadjoint operator in a Hilbert space $H$. Let $n$ be an
arbitrary integer and let $u_1,\ldots,u_{n-1}$ be an arbitrary
system of $n-1$ linearly independent elements of $H$. Denote
\begin{equation}
\max_{\substack{v\in H, v\neq
0\\(v,u_1)=0,\ldots,(v,u_n)=0}}\frac{(Tv,v)}{(v,v)}=m(u_1,\ldots,
u_{n-1}) \label{eqn10}
\end{equation}
Then the $n$-th eigenvalue of $T$ is equal to the minimum of these
maxima, when minimizing over all linearly independent systems
$u_1,\ldots u_{n-1}$ in $H$,
\begin{equation}
\mu_n = \min_{\substack{u_1,\ldots, u_{n-1}\in H}} m(u_1,\ldots,
u_{n-1}) \label{eqn20}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
The above equations are automatically numbered as equation
(\ref{eqn10}) and (\ref{eqn20}).


\section{Lists Environments}

You can create numbered, bulleted, and description lists (Use the
Itemization or Enumeration buttons, or click on the Insert menu
then chose an item from the Enumeration submenu):

\begin{enumerate}
\item List item 1

\item List item 2

\begin{enumerate}
\item A list item under a list item.

\item Just another list item under a list item.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Third level list item under a list item.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fourth and final level of list items allowed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bullet item 1

\item Bullet item 2

\begin{itemize}
\item Second level bullet item.

\begin{itemize}
\item Third level bullet item.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fourth (and final) level bullet item.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Description List] Each description list item has a term
followed by the description of that term.

\item[Bunyip] Mythical beast of Australian Aboriginal legends.
\end{description}

\backmatter \appendix

\chapter{The First Appendix}

The \verb"\appendix" command should be used only once. Subsequent
appendices can be created using the Chapter command.

\chapter{The Second Appendix}

Some text for the second Appendix.

This text is a sample for a short bibliography. You can cite a
book by making use of the command \verb"\cite{KarelRektorys}":
\cite{KarelRektorys}. Papers can be cited similarly:
\cite{Bertoti97}. If you want multiple citations to appear in a
single set of square brackets you must type all of the citation
keys inside a single citation, separating each with a comma. Here
is an example: \cite{Bertoti97, Szeidl2001, Carlson67}.
