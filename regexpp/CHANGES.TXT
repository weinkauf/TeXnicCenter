This version 200:
CHANGED:  Allocator usage, to improve efficiency with instance based allocators.
CHANGED:  regress.h, various fixes for various Borland C++ versions, allocators cleaned up.
ADDED:    Win32 specific localisation code.
ADDED:    C and C++ specific localisation code.
ADDED:    collating element and equivalence class support.
CHANGED:  Character class declarations.
CHANGED:  Behaviour of ranges to deal with locales.
ADDED:    Support for some perl escape sequences (but not yet (?...) ).
CHANGED:  regbase::icase flag now turns on case insensitivity,
          traits class char_regex_traits_i is now depreciated.
CHANGED:  reg_grep now takes a predicate not an output iterator,
          allows user code to terminate search midway through,
          and to use regular callback function with grep.
CHANGED:  Modified search heuristics to improve certain expression
          types, especially expressions which start with a literal
          string, or a single character repeat.  The latter are much
          less likely to become pathological now.
ADDED:    High level C++ class RegEx.

Version 111:
BUG:      Wouldn't compile directly on C++ Builder 4 when it was released
          (not really a bug - more an incompatability)
          
FIXED:    All bugs discovered prior to this version (below).

Version 110:
BUG:      reg_match::maybe_assign could lead to pointer 
          overrun in certain (rare) circumstances.

FIXED:    All bugs discovered prior to this version (below).
FIXED:    Support for VC++, GCC, EGCS.
CHANGED:  Regress.h to work around various compiler bugs.

Version 100:
BUG:      Literal "," not recognised as a literal.

FIXED:    All bugs discovered prior to this version (below).
ADDED:    Regress.exe, regression test application.

Version 095
BUG:      wide character sets that start with ^ not recognised,
          for example [^[:space:]] will not find anything.
BUG:      reg_grep fails if match occurs at first character.
BUG:      If regcomp fails, internal data not freed.
BUG:      reg_grep fails to reinitialise match after assignment
          to output iterator.  Line start optimised search restarts
          from the wrong location if the match is longer than one line.
BUG:      POSIX API functions can propagate C++ exceptions if the
          default allocator can throw exceptions.
BUG:      character sets don't function correctly when regbase::char_classes
          is not set.
